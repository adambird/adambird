Working from home today so decided to be brave and cut down my steerer tube. <p /> Mark, disassemble, panic that mark isn't the right one, reassemble, confirm mark, disassemble, panic again, tell myself not to be so stupid and press on. <p /> Using masking tape as a guide and end sealer worked very well. Will see if I can get the crown-race sorted tomorrow.

Final bits arrived in the post today, including some very keenly priced 105 5700 shifters, from <a href="http://stores.ebay.co.uk/Absolute-Cycles" target="_blank">Absolute Cycles</a>.
