Just finished reading this for the first time many, many years after first watching and loving Bladerunner, the film it inspired. <p /> It's a wonderfully dark and deep story, far more so than the film. The vulnerability of Deckard, subsumed in the naivety and beliefs of the post-apocalyptic world he inhabits, is a far cry from the cerebral, flawed hero around which Ridley Scott's film is centred. Philip K Dick's androids and humans are much less binary than their cinematographic counterparts.
They are both enthralling works in their own right and if you've only got round to seeing Bladerunner, you should definitely make time to read the book.
