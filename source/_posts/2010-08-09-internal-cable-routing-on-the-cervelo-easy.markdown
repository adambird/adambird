Wasn't looking forward to this aspect of the build. Was envisaging a frustrating evening of poking and fiddling but it was actually very easy. <p /> The gear cables just appeared at the bottom and the only slightly tricky item was the rear brake cable in the top tube. A pair it needle-nose pliers had that sorted in no time. <p /> Crankset and chain are going on tomorrow. Even without those it's starting to feel like a bike. <p /> Boy it feels good.<img src="/images/internal-cable-routing-on-the-cervelo-easy/photo.jpg">
