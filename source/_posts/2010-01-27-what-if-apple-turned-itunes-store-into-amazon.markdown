If the tablet is going to redefine how content is being delivered, turning the existing concept of magazines into interactive delights, it would make sense to deliver a purchasing experience. <p /> I read a lot of cycling magazines that contain reviews of wonderful products that I invariably MUST have right at that moment. <p /> What if Apple, as part of a new content platform, enabled purchasing of these items, via the iTunes store. <p /> I could buy that wicked new Chainset or spangly new jacket with my existing iTunes account. <p /> That would be a game changing prospect.
