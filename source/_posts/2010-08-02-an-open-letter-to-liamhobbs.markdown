I have a request. <p /> Please stop insulting me in posts and tweets. Please stop re-tweeting my comments with snide remarks. Please stop commenting on posts I make, whatever the web site. I've tried ignoring you but that just seemed to make matters worse. <p /> I blocked you on Facebook and Twitter in the hope that it would encourage you to move on. <p /> Your pursuit of me despite all this is threatening and could be considered harassment. <p /> It is time to draw a line under this. <p /> I do not want you to comment on this post or refer to it. I just need you to stop. <p /> Our paths will no doubt cross during cycling club events. When that happens let's be civil and polite. Apart from that we have no reason to interact. <p /> Please respect this request.
