To access &nbsp;SQL Azure database, you will need SQL Server Management Studio 2008 R2 CTP. The standard SSMS version doesn't cope with the slightly different schema of the cloud based cousin of the SQL 2008 we all know and love.<p />The Express edition of this is available here:&nbsp;<p /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c772467d-e45b-43e1-9208-2c7b663d7ad1&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c772467d-e45b-43e1-9208-2c7b663d7ad1&amp;displaylang=en</a><p />Just make sure you read the download options and don't do what I did. I downloaded just the database engine without the tools. Cue head scratching and that oh so familiar feeling of the dunce when I realised what not paying attention resulted in :)
