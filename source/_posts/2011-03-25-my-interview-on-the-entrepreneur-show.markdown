I was lucky enough to be interviewed by <a href="http://twitter.com/robwilmot">@robwilmot</a> on his <a href="http://rob.fibreca.mp">Entrepreneur Show</a> yesterday. It was a great opportunity to share my views on how Nottingham is going to harness some of the current successes in the creative and technology scene to really cement is position as a leading centre for the UK.
