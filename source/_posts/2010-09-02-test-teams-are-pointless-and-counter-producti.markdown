In an Agile world unit tests and integration tests, in our case driven <br />by BDD declared stories, are a fundamental part of a development <br />team's output. It could be argued that this is the most important <br />element as these both prove the software works and document what it is <br />supposed to do. <p /> Coverage is key to the success of this. The developers need to ensure <br />their tests cover sufficient scenarios so as to ensure the software <br />delivers when used in anger. <p /> The traditional approach is to have a dedicated test team that checks <br />the code in isolation as developers 'can't be trusted' to do it <br />themselves. <p /> Personally I think this is balderdash. <p /> The test-team-as-gatekeeper approach encourages a lack of <br />responsibility in the development team. They can produce what they <br />like, safe in the knowledge that the test team will pick it up. And, <br />if they don't, well they're mainly to blame rather than the <br />developers. After all, they're not testers. <p /> Far better to have developers engaged all the way to delivery and beyond. <p /> Pair programming, peer reviews and giving rapid iterations for the <br />customer to critique and break all ensure the coverage is complete. <br />But there is nothing like actually engaging with the user to really <br />bring home the importance of the feature being worked on or to bring <br />in to stark relief the usability assumptions they've made. <p /> So, death to test teams. There is no place for them in an agile world.
