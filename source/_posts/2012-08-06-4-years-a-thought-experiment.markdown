What would you like to be recognised for in 4 years time?

What are the steps required to get there?

Would your life be better if you did the first step?

And the next one?

The Olympics is bloody brilliant because it demonstrates with crystal clarity that success is down to dedication, following a process and constant learning and revising the approach.

If that's not a lesson for life in general, I don't know what is.
