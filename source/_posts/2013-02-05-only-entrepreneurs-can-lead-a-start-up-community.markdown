I'm reading [Brad Feld's](http://www.feld.com) book [Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360061822&sr=8-1) at the moment. It shares his ideas and experience from being keenly involved in establishing the start-up community in Boulder, Colorado.

One of his key assertions is that entrepreneurs must lead such a community:

> The most critical principle of a startup community is that entrepreneurs must lead it. Lots of different people are involved in the startup community and many nonentrepreneurs play key roles. Unless the entrepreneurs lead, the startup community will not be sustainable over time.
<!-- more -->
He goes on to say

> I define an entrepreneur as someone who has co-founded a company. I differentiate between "high-growth entrepreneurial companies" and "small businesses". Both are important, but they are different things. 

Later in the book he describes how half a dozen such people "ignited the entrepreneurial revolution" on Boulder. A city of 250k people. Nottingham has around 800k. 

If you follow Brad's assertion then in order for the Creative Quarter project to create sustainable economic development driven by new ambitious businesses then those of us leading high-growth businesses need to take responsibility for it.

If you're one of those people, please get in touch.

Whether you're an entrepreneur or not, if you want to be part of making this initative successful, I'd recommend reading the book.
