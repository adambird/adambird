Took to the Peak District again today to attempt back-to-back century rides as training for La Marmotte in July.

Never got round to swapping over to a compact chainset after yesterday's really hilly route with Hervé (3,300M climbing, 115 miles) and as today was with Mark, a strong and experienced rider, it was always going to be hard.

It was hard.

But I made it and suddenly La Marmotte is feeling every so slightly less daunting.
