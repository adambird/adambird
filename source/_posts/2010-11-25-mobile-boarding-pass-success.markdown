I've tried mobile boarding passes before without success. By the time I've tried to navigate round my phone to get to the appropriate image or web site, getting a piece of paper out has generally been quicker. So it was with a degree of scepticism that I tried out the BA iPhone app with it's board pass option for a flight to Lyon today.It worked a treat.
The key for me was that it worked well enough for the gate agent who hadn't used it before to let me board without issue.
Why did it work this time and not before? A well designed app with good state management and fast app switching was they key. It meant I wasn't tentatively nursing my phone as I approached each of the check points desperately trying to keep the screen alive while not navigating away from the boarding code.
A long promised revolution in travel documentation may well be upon us.
