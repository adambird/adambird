Stopped at the Premier Inn in Port Solent to break up the long drive back from France this weekend and am really glad we did. <p /> We arrived at the end of a long day of travelling which was made longer than expected by very slow progress getting off the ferry and through passport control. Incidentally the immigration officer was in fine spirits given the knackered and undoubtedly surly holiday makers he was encountering. <p /> The woman on reception at the hotel couldn't do enough to help us: <p /> Parking was full so we were concerned about 4 bikes on the back of the car in the overflow car park - no problem we'll put them in a meeting room for you. <br />We were too late for food from nearby restaurants - no problem, here's a takeaway delivery menu <br />Takeaway won't take our order because there isn't a house number to go with the postcode - no problem, I'll speak to them. <p /> The room was clean, a decent size with comfy beds. We all had a great nights sleep. <p /> Breakfast the next morning was busy so we had to wait for a table, the staff member suggested we help ourselves to coffee and juice while we waited on the reception seating. There were about 10 families waiting but there was enough seating and because of the progressive approach of making sure we all had a drink in our hands everyone was happy waiting. When we had breakfast the food was plentiful and decent enough quality. <p /> There were so many opportunities for the staff to turn our stay into a bit of a pain through going through the motions rather than helping. Instead every one of them were friendly, helpful and it worked wonders. We left refreshed, fed and pleased we'd stayed the night.
