I've been at Loughborough University this evening having my swim stroke recorded and analysed to see what I can do to improve my swimming.

Fascinating stuff and not quite the horror story I was expecting, which is good.

At one point, while I was warming up, I looked over at the other lanes and was sure I recognised one of the swimmers. I asked the camera man who it was and it was none other than David Davies, Olympic Silver Medalist.

In fact, as it turns out, it was the GB team who were training next to us.

Truly amazing to watch. I've seen it once before when I've done some swim sessions with Richard Stannard [<a href="http://www.richardstannard.com">http://www.richardstannard.com</a>] the triathlete and world champion we sponsor at Esendex.

The seeming effortless power is truly staggering.&nbsp;

One day...

...I might see it again.
