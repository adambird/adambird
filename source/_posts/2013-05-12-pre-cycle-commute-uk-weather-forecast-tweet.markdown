I've been playing around ([see here](../pushing-info-to-pebble-watch)) and have set up a simple service that tweets me every morning at 7:30am with a simple weather forecast. Importantly it has the information I want as a cycle commuter.

+ Wind speed &amp; direction
+ Likelihood of rain
+ Temperature

<!-- more -->
The result looks a bit like this

    @adambird
    Mon 13 - BEESTON
    11C Light rain
    11mph WSW
    Rain 84%

It's just one less thing to have to look at in the morning.

Would you like to receive the messages too?

I've got some ideas for developing it and if there's enough interest I will. It doesn't cost me anything to run other than time at the moment so I thought it was worth putting out there.

If you'd like to give it a go. Then adam dot bird at gmail dot com or @adambird and let me know 

1. Where you want the forecast for
2. What time you want it

Also any thoughts on what info would be useful to you before you assemble your commuting accessories and attire would be much appreciated.
