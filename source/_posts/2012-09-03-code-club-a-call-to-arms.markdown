Are you a developer? Are you a business owner who employs developers? Have you heard about<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk"> CodeClub</a>?&nbsp;

Code Club is a nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged 9-11. The mission is&nbsp;to give every child in the UK the chance to learn to code. The&nbsp;aim to have a Code Club in 25% of primary schools in the UK by the end of 2014.

What's not to like about being part of that.

A new term is about to start so I urge you to contact your local primary school, either local to home or work, and volunteer to run a club for a term. All the materials are made available by Code Club so it's super easy.

If you're a developer you just have to inspire hungry young minds.

If you employ developers then this a perfect personal development opportunity for your team and a real opportunity for you to give something to your community.

If you're in Nottingham then get in touch with me (<a href="mailto:adam.bird@esendex.com">adam.bird@esendex.com</a>) as the City Council are very, very keen to find ways they can help local employers to make this happen.

So, to summarise

+ Go here [http://codeclub.org.uk/](http://codeclub.org.uk/)
+ Volunteer
+ Inspire the next generation
