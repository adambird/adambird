Brought my bike with me to San Francisco and so glad I did. Julian and I had a big run out on Monday and quick dash over the bridge early Tuesday, but this morning I got up extra early and was really rewarded.

Beautifully sunny, clear morning. Cycling across an iconic landmark. Alpine style ascent and descent. All before a Turkey Hash breakfast at Mel's Diner, 4th and Mission followed by the Web 2 Expo Keynotes.

Work hard, play hard
