Just a thought, but with a new iPhone looming in July of this year along with possibly v4 of the OS could this be one of the reasons the SD card slot is present in the iPad. <p /> The new iPhone will almost certainly have a better camera, microphone, etc as Apple make it the primary content generation device for the masses in their product line-up. <p /> The iPad is being positioned as the content consumption appliance, so having one dock plug into the other dock may well be a possibility. Or, will we get WiFi, using Bonjour, or even Bluetooth transfer of content from the point of generation to the point of consumption. <p /> The iWork products built for the iPad hint at if not content generation, simple content manipulation is also being seen as a target function of the device. <p /> iMovie for iPad anyone?
