Traditionally, not wanting to come home is considered the sign of a good holiday. You never want the fun to end. <p /> However, I reckon being ready to come home is a pretty good indication that you're refreshed, recharged and ready to take on the world again. Your holiday has done it's job. Assuming of course you've had a good time.
