    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Adrian, a good friend and fellow cyclist, wanted to embark on a challenge to mark a significant birthday. He hit upon this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.raleigh.co.uk/tommygodwin205/">Tommy Godwin 205 Mile Challenge</a></p>

<p>Tommy still holds the record he set in 1939 for distance cycled in a year. <strong>75,065 miles</strong>. A daily average of <strong>205 miles</strong>. So if he could do it back in the thirties on a 4 geared steel bike and rudimentary clothing how hard could it be to match just one day.</p>

<p>We found out.</p>

<img src="http://www.adambird.com/images/the-intrepid-five.jpg" width="450px"></p>

<p>At 5am we departed from the Left Lion in Nottingham Market Square, the traditional and iconic local meeting point, with our first stop 80 miles away in Market Drayton. The overal aim was to arrive in Conway, North Wales, via Snowden in time for a welcome drink in The Albion.</p>

<p>Tommy had avoided hills.</p>

<p>Five of us were aiming for the entire route. We were joined by a couple of friends for 2 hours so we made them cycle on the front for as long as possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately one of our number, Steve, succumb to a sickness bug and had to abandon near Burton but the four of us did the right thing by him and left him to make his own way home.</p>

<p>And really, save for a puncture, a couple of chain ships and a psycotic chicken the run to Market Drayton was uneventful.</p>

<p>I invented a new dish at our food stop, the rather splendid <a href="http://www.festivaldraytoncentre.com">Festival Drayton Centre</a>. Jacket potato, beans and bacon shall henceforth be known as <em>Cowboy Jackets</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.adambird.com/images/cowboy-jacket.jpg" width="600px"></p>

<p>Leaving Market Drayton, the home of gingerbread as we discovered, things turned distinctly darker.</p>

<p>Literally.</p>

<p>The promised rain started and persisted for several hours. Route finding became difficult as we tried to avoid the major roads as much as possible. Spirits definitely were on the slide even though we&#8217;d been joined by another couple of friends for the last 125 miles.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.adambird.com/images/raining.jpg" width="600px"></p>

<p>We dropped down to the A5 at Llangollen and thankfully the rain had subsided. The change in terrain as we entered the North Wales mountains broke the group up and soon we were ploughing our lonely furrows, or maybe it was just me.</p>

<p>What the A5 lacked in tranquility it made up for with a splendid road surface and the descent into Betws-y-Coed was a real highlight. I didn&#8217;t know it yet but I had forgotten to eat properly.</p>

<p>This hit me as we left Betws-y-Coed for Capel Curig, a steep climb out of town. I got to the top and suddenly had nothing. I was light-headed, wasn&#8217;t really sure what was happening but just kept pedalling.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.adambird.com/images/dark-time-capel-curig.jpg" width="600px"></p>

<p>This was a strange and dark time that finally ended when I spied the others at the <a href="http://www.pinnaclepursuits.co.uk/cafe.htm">Pinnacle Cafe</a>. Two cans of coke, a bacon and egg bap, coffee and cake restored me somewhat but I left first, determined to get this over with.</p>

<p>I may have been a little grumpy at this point. We were still 60 miles from our destination and we hadn&#8217;t got over Pen-y-Pass (Snowden) yet. I needn&#8217;t have worried. The towering precipice of my imagination was a relatively small rise and we soon hurtling down the valley to Llanberis.</p>

<p>Bizarrely I bumped into a college mate I hadn&#8217;t seen for 17 years on the ascent.</p>

<p>So the worst was over, one more hill and then it was the flat run round the coast.</p>

<p>Errmm no.</p>

<p>The &#8216;one more hill&#8217; was a 20+% gradient monster that was just laughably hard. Laughably in that make it stop kind of way reserved for the bit in films when the protagonist know&#8217;s that he&#8217;s finally been broken.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.adambird.com/images/the-last-climb.jpg" width="600px"></p>

<p>The &#8216;flat run&#8217; was lots of steep short inclines and then Adrian and I lost the cycle lane and were forced to use the A55 dual carriageway picking up a puncture for our trouble.</p>

<p>As the person responsible for the route I was perhaps the least popular person on the road by that point. The fact that I was sharing the suffering didn&#8217;t really engender much sympathy from my companions.</p>

<p>I also bonked again near Caernarfon.</p>

<p>Finally Conway came into sight around the bay and we knew we&#8217;d made it.</p>

<ul>
<li>211 miles</li>
<li>13hrs of actual cycling (16hrs in total)</li>
<li>3,000 metres of climbing</li>
<li>7,000 calories</li>
</ul>

<p>Rarely has beer tasted finer than those first few in The Albion. Made all the more special because Steve (who&#8217;d become ill) had phoned up the pub to put some money behind the bar for us.</p>

<p>Legend!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.adambird.com/images/the-albion.jpg" width="600px"></p>

<p>A double century is an epic cycling challenge and one that I could only recommend before doing it or towards the end of the evening after having done it. My answer wouldn&#8217;t have been quite so positive while actuall engaged in it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Build up list of requirements</li>
<li>Put those requirements in priority order</li>
<li>Review that list and decide the key value points along that list</li>
</ol>


<p>Have a discussion with developer(s) around how much time/money they estimate it would take to get to various points on the list. Agree to work together to deliver the first value point</p>

<p>Building software is not a repeatable process. It is a complex interaction of varying inputs and demands. Accept that</p>

<p>a) you don’t actually know what you want until you actually try and deliver it</p>

<p>b) the developers won’t actually know how long it will take until they actually try and deliver it</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know I have a new venture called One Diary. We&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be considered one of the best 10% of entries into the Start Up competition at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://thesummit.co">The Summit</a> conference. As I&#8217;m sure you can imagine, being selected to be represented at such a prestigious and high-profile conference would be a massive boost for us.</p>

<p>I need your help getting through to the next round.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Each selected candidate has produced a 60 sec video explaining why they should be represented. In an unashamed popularity contest, the videos that get the most votes win.</p>

<p>You can view our video and vote for us here</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not all. Thanks to the power of the Internet and it&#8217;s unrivalled power in celebrating vacuous love. You can ask/cajole/strong-arm/threaten your friends to do the same.</p>

<p>They can help you, help One Diary become more popular than all the others in a list of people you haven&#8217;t heard of and have no reference to compare; and kittens may be saved as a result.</p>

<p>Here are five handy tweets to help you share the love:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So a predictable furore gripped my twitter feed as footage of Lottie Dexter, head of the UK&#8217;s <a href="http://yearofcode.org">Year of Code</a> initiative, appearance on Newsnight emerged.</p>

<iframe width="500" height="271" src="http://www.adambird.com//www.youtube.com/embed/-7x7GYItzS4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>My concern is not that she doesn&#8217;t know how to code but that she was able to so comprehensively belittle the very skillset she was trying to apparently promote.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&#8217;m a tech entrepreneur and developer who&#8217;s directly employed around 50 developers in my companies and thus have interviewed hundreds. As well as that I&#8217;m in my second year running <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk">Code Clubs</a> and am a Governor (Director now it&#8217;s an Academy) at my local secondary school.</p>

<p>If you translate what Lottie was saying to other industries, it&#8217;d be like saying you just need to learn how to lay bricks in a straight line and you can build a house.</p>

<p>Belittling the craft of software development, indeed any skill, can only be of detriment to the UK economy. Yes, I understand that the messaging is about breaking down the barriers but that is not going to prepare people for when it gets difficult.</p>

<p>Software development, like all skills, requires hard work, motivation and endeavour to reach a level at which you can make a valuable contribution. We need to help young people to find the motivation to get through those hard times.</p>

<p>The messaging of UK Coding/Lottie Dexter is in danger of just making people feel stupid because they don&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>As someone who is trying to teach children to write software, the hardset job I have is keeping them motivated. Giving them context that helps them see why the hard work is worth it. The drop-off rate when we moved from <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> to HTML and then onto <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> was considerable.</p>

<p>The few that have stuck with it have found their own motivation and my role is to nurture and facilitate that. Hopefully turning round those that are wavering.</p>

<p>As an employer, the only people I&#8217;m interested in are those that care about what they do, are always looking to better themselves and a prepared to put the work in to better themselves. Those are the people that can make a difference to an organisation and thus to the UK economy.</p>

<p>If we want the build a skills based economy then we should celebrate those that have worked hard to develop those skills not belittle them.</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambird.com/a-ps200m-acquisition"/>
    <updated>2014-01-17T21:39:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.adambird.com/images/world_beater_ball_web.png"></p>

<p>I nearly snorted out my cornflakes on Friday morning when I read that <a href="http://www.nottinghampost.com/200-million-takeover-Nottingham-technology/story-20454150-detail/story.html">TDX Group had been sold to Equifax for £200 million</a>. It is, on the face of it an eye-watering valuation, but I think it&#8217;s actually more of a reality check for Nottingham.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In the years I&#8217;ve been working in Nottingham there&#8217;s been an air of apology to everything we do. We&#8217;re not from London or the South East and while we try hard we can&#8217;t expect to be as successful as those lucky southerners. I&#8217;ve been guilty of it too.</p>

<p>Ambitions naturally get tempered and we think it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable for friends and colleagues to go away and find their fortune elsewhere.</p>

<p>The acquisition of TDX reminds us that this is a bullshit attitude.</p>

<p>In our city we have world class data analysts and visionaries that have made TDX into a asset that a global company had to have for a substantial sum.</p>

<p>We have world-class scientists in <a href="http://www.haemostatix.com">Haemostatix</a> forming a revolutionary blood clotting agent that will transform surgery and trauma management as well as <a href="http://www.scancell.co.uk">Scancell</a> creating a cure for frickin&#8217; cancer.</p>

<p>Then you start talking to the guys at <a href="http://www.crytek.com/career/studios/overview/nottingham">Crytek</a> about the ground breaking stuff they&#8217;re doing with gaming engines.</p>

<p>We are surrounded by world class talent and organisations. And these are just companies I&#8217;ve come into contact with in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>So I suggest we stop apologising and finding reasons not to be as successful as we could be. Let&#8217;s reset our ambition and do justice to ourselves, our careers, our companies and our city.</p>

<p>We deserve it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having <a href="http://www.esendex.co.uk/blog/post/behind-the-acquisition-what-new-ownership-means-for-esendexs-growth-strategy/">exited Esendex</a> this summer, it&#8217;s time to start all over again and have another go at changing the world.</p>

<p>The new startup is called <a href="http://www.onediaryapp.com">One Diary</a> and is delivering a flexible and collaborative diary. The antithesis of the current rigid silos we find ourselves cursed with at the moment.</p>

<p>To change the calendars that everyone uses right now (Exchange, Google, etc) is a big, hairy audacious ambition but it really, really needs doing. It&#8217;s just going to require a lot of small steps.</p>

<p>My focus now is on two things</p>

<!-- more -->


<ol>
<li>building a prototype to demonstrate servicing what I believe to be an initial, compelling use case</li>
<li>finding the founding team members</li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s the second of these that this post is about. The founding team I&#8217;m imagining is as follows.</p>

<h3>CEO (me)</h3>

<p>Product strategy, growth and ensuring there&#8217;s enough money in the bank (through timely fundraising and/or revenue generation).</p>

<h3>Back-end Ruby Developer</h3>

<p>This is a platform play so the working hypothesis is that an API first approach is critical to it&#8217;s ongoing success. The current implementation uses an event-sourced domain with a CQRS approach to the API. This is a real software engineering role.</p>

<h3>Front-end JavaScript Developer</h3>

<p>A rock solid, rich user experience delivered to web browsers is crucial to ensure people continue to use the service. No jQuery hacking, this is building a fully featured application that is hosted in the browser of all sorts of devices.</p>

<h3>Design, Branding and UX Designer</h3>

<p>The kind of data we&#8217;ll be holding for people is very private and thus we need to be sure that we interact with customers in way that both delights them and gives them confidence in us.</p>

<hr />

<p>The mode of operation will be a complete buzzword fest: agile, test-driven, continuously deployed, iterative, empircal decision making, constant learning. Anyone who knows me, or how Esendex operates, will know that these aren&#8217;t just words but are fundamental to how I try and operate.</p>

<p>Location is pretty open. I would love everyone to be within commuting distance of Nottingham but that just isn&#8217;t realistic if I want to work with the best people (and I do) so I&#8217;m looking at anywhere in the UK right now.</p>

<p>My plan/idea is to bring the team together for an intense period at the start (in Nottingham) and then we come together fortnightly for a retro on the previous iteration and to plan and start the next iteration. So being able to get to Nottingham without a crazy amount of hassle would probably be helpful.</p>

<p>Salary and options (with a proper earning and vesting schedule) for these roles. I&#8217;m seed funding this personally so salaries aren&#8217;t going to be crazy. You&#8217;ll definitely be able to earn more money doing something else but where would be the fun in that?</p>

<p>If you know someone who might fit please send them this post.</p>

<p>If you are that person then get in touch adam.bird [at] gmail.com and let&#8217;s see if we can make this happen.</p>

<p>What have I missed?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a strong correlation between having Hautacam on your TdF palmares and performance enhancement through drugs. I took the opposite approach and rode it with a mild hangover.</p>

<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://www.strava.com/activities/75540184/embed/58d175651805aebc2049b2bacecac14f3c4ac4d6'></iframe>


<p>I got chatting to a local cyclist at one of the campsite dinners who told me how beautiful this climb was. Also, the start of the climb was only about 8km from where we are staying so I couldn&#8217;t not do.</p>

<p>However, it turned out to be lot harder than I was anticipating.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The pattern of this climb is one of reported average gradients bearing little correlation to the actual gradients you experience.</p>

<p>A reported 8% km section is inevitably several flatter sections followed by ramps of more than 10%. For some reason I thought this climb got easier about halfway up but saw no evidence until in the final 2km. I was out of my saddle for more on this climb than any of the others I&#8217;d done in the Pyrenees over the last week.</p>

<p>The lower slopes are tree-lined and in morning shade that makes the torture slightly more bearable.</p>

<p>Around about 6km from the end the good stuff really starts to happen. Amazing views across the valleys that meet at Argeles-Gazost.</p>

<p>Across the Val d&#8217;Azun with the Soulor and Aubisque Cols at it&#8217;s head and the Pic des Tourettes, whose name entertained the schoolboy in me, towering over. And up towards Cauterets with Vignemale, the tallest mountain in the French Pyrenees. The ascent up to Hautacam being on the western side, these were all bathed in morning sun.</p>

<p>After a punishing 2km from around 5km to go things started to get easier and it&#8217;s possible to take in the view now the trees no longer line the road. I had the usual Pyrenean livestock to negotiate and the last km was an easy run round to the TdF finish.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adambird/9539109144/" title="Hautacam finish by adamebird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5485/9539109144_f49f3523c0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Hautacam finish"></a></p>

<p>What I then discovered, after taking the obligatory photo opp, was that there was still another 1.2km to go up to the top of Col de Tramessel. There you&#8217;ll find a refuge and the start of several Nordic ski routes and views over the other side of the Hautacam massif.</p>

<p>The descent was, again, brilliant. Lot&#8217;s more of accelerating out hairpins in the big ring and really feeling like you&#8217;re living the dream. I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that the real danger on Pyrenean descents is hitting some fresh livestock poo. Terrifying when you come hurtling round a bend and find shiny brown splodges across the road.</p>

<p>One more cycling day to go. I think I&#8217;m going to try something a little off the beaten track for my last excursion.</p>

<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://www.strava.com/activities/74848523/embed/79861b92c9d6541ca3dcc1db7597fbd8a0947e75'></iframe>


<p>The plan today was to take in both ascents of the Col du Tormalet. We&#8217;re staying close (20km) to the start of the west ascent so and out, up and over, and back seemed like a &#8216;sensible&#8217; plan.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The one challenge was the road closures due to the flood damage experienced earlier in the season between Barèges and Luz-Saint-Sauveur, the first section of the climb. The roads were closed from 08:00 to 12:00 and 13:30 to 17:30. So in order to make sure I was passed the roadworks before they closed I had to leave at 05:45 so I could descend back home during the lunchtime period.</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t so bad as it meant, after a ride to Luz in the dark, I had the climb to myself. It seemed no one else was fool as me. The climb starts pretty much straight out of Luz with 7-9% sections all the way up to Barèges. It was on this section that I discover the devastation the Le Bastan river had wraught. Fast melting, unusually high snow fall had ripped mercilessly through the valley tearing homes and roads apart.</p>

<p>As you go past 10km to go the road flattens to 5% which seems blessed relief at the time. As you round the bend at the end of the first flatter section you get a glimpse of your destination. The notch in the ridge ahead of you is the chairlift a few hundred metres south of the road pass itself.</p>

<p>After an easy section through the ski station at Super-Barèges things start to ramp up again and you can&#8217;t help feeling this is where it all starts to kick off when the Col is the destination for a summit finish. It&#8217;s at this point that the road painting starts to appear. Including a timely reminder that &#8216;pain is weakness leaving the body&#8217;.</p>

<p>More curious comes at around 5km to go when there is a Dutch section with names of national riders followed by what appears to be 500m of 1-3m long sperm. If I hadn&#8217;t been cycling I would have taken a photo so you&#8217;ll just have to believe me. Would love to know what it&#8217;s about.</p>

<p>Just at the end of the sperm, if you look up to your left you can see the observatory balanced precariously on the top of the Pic du Midi. Completely oblivious to your plight as all it&#8217;s attention is focused on the heavens.</p>

<p>2km is when it gets really serious. There&#8217;s a flat&#8217;ish section until a righthand hairpin at which point it&#8217;s a push skyward to the summit. Time to get into that pain cave and feel right at home as there is no respite now until the top. When you round the final lefthand hairpin under the chairlift any thoughts of an elegant, seated approach evaporate as the gradient, coupled with it&#8217;s position on the climb, require every muscle you can muster to overcome it.</p>

<p>I was alone on the Col at 08:30 when I arrived so a quick snap and straight down the other side to the ski resort at La Mongie, 4km below the Col, for what I hoped would be breakfast. Unfortunately all I could find open was a bar that was just serving coffee. A couple of short ones and I was off down what felt like would be the best descent of the day.</p>

<p>The 8km from La Mongie consisted of long straights and open corners that you could see through. I&#8217;m no dare-devil descender so didn&#8217;t push it, especially with some new wheels that I haven&#8217;t got used to yet, but I felt confident and enjoyed every minute of it. Maybe partly down to a masochistic pleasure taken in knowing I&#8217;d be coming back up shortly.</p>

<p>I stopped at Sainte-Marie de Campan, the start of the east ascent, turned straight around and started the ascent up. The first part is very easy, 3-4% easy, and at this point I was feeling pretty pleased with myself. One ascent done and feeling strong for the next one. Two things put pay to that confidence.</p>

<p>Firstly the sun. Although it was only around 10:00 this side of the valley was bathed in strong sunshine. The first climb had been in glorious, early morning shade. I&#8217;d taken great pleasure in watching as the sun first picked out the peaks on the opposite side of the valley and slowly crept down, illuminating them with a warm glow. This side was just unrelentingly hot. I remembered far more trees on the descent, though in reality the open sections just went past more quickly when I was hurtling down.</p>

<p>Secondly the climbing was quite different. This is purported to be the easier side but I found it a relentless 8-10% slog. Those long straights with open corners were reminiscent of the climb up Ventoux from Bedoin where there is no respite whatsoever for miles. I accept that I wasn&#8217;t necessarily approaching the climb with fresh legs but any dreams I had of arriving fresh at the top quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>As I approached La Mongie again I formed a loose agreement with a more senior French rider, sporting a local club&#8217;s jersey, a substantial grey mustache and astride a beautiful steel Colnago of some reasonable vintage. We worked together through and out of the inelegant architecture of the ski-station. It felt quite surreal with tourists arriving and going about their day, by now most things were open, as we laboured though the streets navigating the donkeys and goats that were hanging out like petulant teenagers.</p>

<p>When I said we worked together, what I meant was, I did what he did. This man who oozed cycling experience became my link to my purpose as I started to lose grip on reality a little. When he drank, I drank. When he got out of his saddle, I got out of my saddle.</p>

<p>With 3km to go, everything was hurting. What I thought had been the pain cave on the final 2km of the first ascent was actually a charming pied-a-tierre with sea views. Everything was hurting. I was having trouble focusing. I was empty. I was a pedalling automoton.</p>

<p>I finally lost his wheel on the last hairpin and found myself close to tears as walkers skipped gaily passed.</p>

<p>And then it was over. I was shaking. 2 cans of coke, a massive salad and a coffee as I sat bathed in sun outside the restaurant at the top soon restored me to some measure of health and sanity. Quick photo and then off down to make sure I made the lunchtime slot for the road reopening.</p>

<p>Another wonderful descent reminded me that I just love high mountain descents. There is something glorious about miles and miles of hurtling downhill.</p>

<p>The road from Luz to Argeles-Gazost, where we are staying, runs through a gorge and it&#8217;s here I had my Jérémy Roy moment. As I hurtled along the gorge through the rock-fall tunnels, pedalling furiously dragging the last drops of energy from my aching legs I felt like I was in a Pyrenean TDF stage. I been out on a breakaway in the high mountains all day, see Jérémy Roy in 2012 Tour, and was gunning for the finish in of the valley towns.</p>

<p>Then my back said don&#8217;t be so stupid, you&#8217;re 41 and somewhat out of condition.</p>

<p>Oh and there absolutely wasn&#8217;t a festival-come-market thing just below the Tourmalet on the west side that meant that roadworks and thus road closures had been suspended to ensure people could get to it.</p>

<p>So I needn&#8217;t have got up at 5:30 but I&#8217;m kinda glad I did.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around (<a href="../pushing-info-to-pebble-watch">see here</a>) and have set up a simple service that tweets me every morning at 7:30am with a simple weather forecast. Importantly it has the information I want as a cycle commuter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wind speed &amp; direction</li>
<li>Likelihood of rain</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<p>The result looks a bit like this</p>

<pre><code>@adambird
Mon 13 - BEESTON
11C Light rain
11mph WSW
Rain 84%
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s just one less thing to have to look at in the morning.</p>

<p>Would you like to receive the messages too?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got some ideas for developing it and if there&#8217;s enough interest I will. It doesn&#8217;t cost me anything to run other than time at the moment so I thought it was worth putting out there.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to give it a go. Then adam dot bird at gmail dot com or @adambird and let me know</p>

<ol>
<li>Where you want the forecast for</li>
<li>What time you want it</li>
</ol>


<p>Also any thoughts on what info would be useful to you before you assemble your commuting accessories and attire would be much appreciated.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adambird/8730919595/" title="Weather forecast to my Pebble by adamebird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7283/8730919595_b631670ee7.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Weather forecast to my Pebble"></a></p>

<p>My <a href="http://getpebble.com">Pebble Watch</a> finally arrived this week so I thought I should have a go at pushing information to it. As a cycle commuter I look at the weather every day and am primarily interested in wind direction and rain forecast so I though it would be neat to have this appear on my watch every morning.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> was the obvious place to start, especially as weather notifications are standard recipes. SMS or Twitter would be good channels to start but neither would work for me.</p>

<p>SMS just didn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;m in the UK on Orange. And Twitter wouldn&#8217;t allow sending a DM to myself (though as you&#8217;ll see from my solution I could have just done this).</p>

<p>I had heard reports of a Pebble push API but haven&#8217;t been able to find any documentation so I resorted to handcrafting my own solution.</p>

<h2>Pebblebot</h2>

<p>I created a simple Ruby command line script to handle the weather initially <a href="https://github.com/adambird/pebblebot">adambird/pebblebot</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve resorted to twitter DMs from another &#8216;bot&#8217; account I&#8217;ve created for the purpose. Not ideal as I end up with DMs on several devices which I don&#8217;t want. Once the Pebble Push API is available then this should be an easy swap out.</p>

<p>I host this on a Heroku at zero cost by having an app with no dynos and just a free <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/scheduler">Heroku Scheduler</a> that runs the script every morning.</p>

<p>At the moment this will need to be manually changed to daylight saving so I might need to thing of something more powerful for scheduling.</p>

<p>Have various ideas for improving and extending this, including making something that anyone could use. If you&#8217;re interested let me know what would be useful to you <a href="http://twitter.com/adambird">@adambird</a>.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve now added support for <a href="http://pushover.net">Pushover</a> and extended the command line options. See the <a href="https://github.com/adambird/pebblebot">adambird/pebblebot</a> for full details</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been put forward for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.frameworkha.org/jail_bail">Jail &amp; Bail</a> event in support of <a href="http://www.frameworkha.org">Framework</a> and I need your help (money).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.frameworkha.org">Framework</a> is the charity <a href="http://www.esendex.com">Esendex</a> are primarily working with and supporting. Their goal is to stop homelessness in all of it&#8217;s forms. What appealed to us the most about working with them was their approach to helping people get the support and training they need to enable them to change their own lives.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When you start talking to the team you begin to understand how perilously easy it would be for any of us to become homeless. But, also how tactical intervention and support can rescue people and allow them to participate and contribute to their community again.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re doing a number of things with Framework as a team from pure help to fundraising. It&#8217;s the latter that I&#8217;m currently involved in.</p>

<p>Jail &amp; Bail is a bit of fun designed to raise money for and profile of Framework. Myself and 5 other local people with profiles are being jailed for a variety of crimes.</p>

<p>Mine being <strong>&#8216;the gratuitous wearing of lycra in a public space&#8217;</strong>.</p>

<p>We will be tried, and in all likelihood, convicted in the courtroom of the Galleries of Justice on May 16th. From their we will be taken down to the cell/dungeon where we will stay until we raise £1000 &#8216;bail&#8217; money to be paid to Framework.</p>

<p>You can help keep me out of jail and help stop homelessness by donating on my <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/adambird-jailbail/">Just Giving page</a>. I urge you to do this sooner rather than later as 2 weeks is not a lot of time to raise £1000.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any support in spreading the word as well. Email your colleagues, click the twitter, facebook and Google+ links and do what you can for this important cause.</p>

<p>Framework&#8217;s mission is a crucial one if we want to build an economically successful city that celebrates and supports in equal measure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m an eternally frustrated user of computer and phone calendars. I find all sorts of aspects of using them clumsy and ill-suited to the way I work.</p>

<p>Am I the only one?</p>

<p>I have some ideas about how they could be improved but I only represent one perspective. If you use calendars and are within striking distance of either Nottingham or London I&#8217;d love to come and buy you a coffee.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Basically I&#8217;m looking for 15-20 mins of your time in which I&#8217;d like to understand how you currently use calendars and what your current pain points are. Where do you have to work round existing solutions in order to fit them into your way of working?</p>

<p>In return I can offer a warm, invigorating beverage and an empathetic ear as you unload your calendar related tales of woe. I might even throw in a muffin :)</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you&#8217;d be up for please get in touch <a href="http://twitter.com/adambird">@adambird</a> or <a href="mailto:adam.bird@gmail.com">adam.bird@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <id>http://www.adambird.com/only-entrepreneurs-can-lead-a-start-up-community</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m reading <a href="http://www.feld.com">Brad Feld&#8217;s</a> book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360061822&amp;sr=8-1">Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City</a> at the moment. It shares his ideas and experience from being keenly involved in establishing the start-up community in Boulder, Colorado.</p>

<p>One of his key assertions is that entrepreneurs must lead such a community:</p>

<blockquote><p>The most critical principle of a startup community is that entrepreneurs must lead it. Lots of different people are involved in the startup community and many nonentrepreneurs play key roles. Unless the entrepreneurs lead, the startup community will not be sustainable over time.</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>He goes on to say</p>

<blockquote><p>I define an entrepreneur as someone who has co-founded a company. I differentiate between &#8220;high-growth entrepreneurial companies&#8221; and &#8220;small businesses&#8221;. Both are important, but they are different things.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later in the book he describes how half a dozen such people &#8220;ignited the entrepreneurial revolution&#8221; on Boulder. A city of 250k people. Nottingham has around 800k.</p>

<p>If you follow Brad&#8217;s assertion then in order for the Creative Quarter project to create sustainable economic development driven by new ambitious businesses then those of us leading high-growth businesses need to take responsibility for it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re one of those people, please get in touch.</p>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or not, if you want to be part of making this initative successful, I&#8217;d recommend reading the book.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The announcement of Nottingham&#8217;s City Deal last week (<a href="http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files_dpm/resources/Nottingham-City-Deal-final.pdf">http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files_dpm/resources/Nottingham-City-Deal-final.pdf</a>) is big deal for entrepreneurship in the city. The council now have the funds and powers to provide the infrastructure and support to the new, innovative businesses that will drive GDP growth in the city and provide the skilled jobs going forward.</p>

<p>But, infrastructure is only one part of the jigsaw. I want to share a couple of thoughts on how we, the business community in Nottingham, can do our bit to support our city in this endeavour.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The incubator without walls concept is predicated on building a sense community among the businesses in the city centre. One where we all come together to share, help and learn from each other for the mutual benefit of us all.</p>

<p>We already have a vibrant community with events like Nott Tuesday, Second Wednesday, GeekUp and Game City Nights bringing people together on a regular basis. All of these events could be bigger and better though. You can support them by attending, encouraging your team to attend, mining your contact book for speakers or your or your team speaking and giving the rest of the community the benefit of your experiences.&lt;/</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t just altruism. This will help you be more successful.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re at the coal-face of a small business growing hard or running to stand still as is the case for many, it&#8217;s easy to shut out distractions. I know exactly what it is like. However, taking time out to share and reflect is invariably valuable. Not only does it ive you some mental space to reset your thought processes you may find someone with similar challenges who, if they haven&#8217;t already solved them and can share their solution, can provide a valuable ally.</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re to build a sustainable future for the city, we need to develop the skills of our young people. This doesn&#8217;t have to be the prevail of large organisations with training schemes and huge CSR budgets. If we really want to empower young people to take control of the learning and inspire them to greatness, they need the opportunity to experience working with small organisations as well.</p>

<p>The challenge for small companies is that when this young, untrained, person represents 20% of your workforce that is a huge risk. The way to assuage that risk is to do what you can, and consider that it&#8217;s probably more than you&#8217;re doing at the moment.</p>

<p>Code Club (<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk">http://codeclub.org.uk</a>) is a great initiative to start introducing children to software development at after school clubs. If you have developers encourage and support them to run a Code Club at their local school, whether they have children or not.</p>

<p>Contact local colleges and explain you can host one or two students on Tuesdays (for example) or encourage your marketing exec to run workshops to show how what they&#8217;re learning now is actually applied in the real world.</p>

<p>My experience of recruiting over the years is seeing a widening disconnect between what is being taught to pass exams and what we as businesses actually do on a daily basis. Colleges like New College Nottingham (<a href="http://www.ncn.ac.uk/content/home.aspx">http://www.ncn.ac.uk/content/home.aspx</a>) have recognised this and are actively looking to engage with the business community to help them solve this.</p>

<p>Again this isn&#8217;t blind altruism. The personal development benefits to mentors are well documented. The business gets to hone a new employee at a fraction of the cost. The city benefits are just a by product.</p>

<p>There will be all sorts of other ways we can all come together to support the vision of Nottingham as a rewarding and enjoyable place to live and work. If the last few years have taught us anything, it&#8217;s that greed and selfishness is road to destruction.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s learn from that and work together to build something sustainable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This caused me a bit of heartache and I found little to help via the usual channels.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d upgraded a Rails 2 app that used Delayed_Job to Rails 3 and was deploying the Heroku Cedar stack. Jobs were being queued but would fail immediately when trying to deserialise with</p>

<pre><code>uninitialized constant Syck::Syck
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>when trying to parse and initialise the handler. Irritatingly the worker logs were showing the jobs as successful.</p>

<p>After messing around with trying to explicitly set the YAML parser in <code>config/boot.rb</code> I found the solution.</p>

<p><code>Syck</code> isn&#8217;t available on the Heroku Cedar stack so you have to include the <code>Psych</code> gem.</p>

<pre><code>gem 'pysch'
</code></pre>

<p>I then ran this on the console to resubmit the jobs and all was good</p>

<pre><code>Delayed::Job.all.each do |job| job.invoke_job ; job.destroy end
</code></pre>
