    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.adambird.com/images/world_beater_ball_web.png"></p>

<p>I nearly snorted out my cornflakes on Friday morning when I read that <a href="http://www.nottinghampost.com/200-million-takeover-Nottingham-technology/story-20454150-detail/story.html">TDX Group had been sold to Equifax for £200 million</a>. It is, on the face of it an eye-watering valuation, but I think it&#8217;s actually more of a reality check for Nottingham.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In the years I&#8217;ve been working in Nottingham there&#8217;s been an air of apology to everything we do. We&#8217;re not from London or the South East and while we try hard we can&#8217;t expect to be as successful as those lucky southerners. I&#8217;ve been guilty of it too.</p>

<p>Ambitions naturally get tempered and we think it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable for friends and colleagues to go away and find their fortune elsewhere.</p>

<p>The acquisition of TDX reminds us that this is a bullshit attitude.</p>

<p>In our city we have world class data analysts and visionaries that have made TDX into a asset that a global company had to have for a substantial sum.</p>

<p>We have world-class scientists in <a href="http://www.haemostatix.com">Haemostatix</a> forming a revolutionary blood clotting agent that will transform surgery and trauma management as well as <a href="http://www.scancell.co.uk">Scancell</a> creating a cure for frickin&#8217; cancer.</p>

<p>Then you start talking to the guys at <a href="http://www.crytek.com/career/studios/overview/nottingham">Crytek</a> about the ground breaking stuff they&#8217;re doing with gaming engines.</p>

<p>We are surrounded by world class talent and organisations. And these are just companies I&#8217;ve come into contact with in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>So I suggest we stop apologising and finding reasons not to be as successful as we could be. Let&#8217;s reset our ambition and do justice to ourselves, our careers, our companies and our city.</p>

<p>We deserve it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having <a href="http://www.esendex.co.uk/blog/post/behind-the-acquisition-what-new-ownership-means-for-esendexs-growth-strategy/">exited Esendex</a> this summer, it&#8217;s time to start all over again and have another go at changing the world.</p>

<p>The new startup is called <a href="http://www.onediaryapp.com">One Diary</a> and is delivering a flexible and collaborative diary. The antithesis of the current rigid silos we find ourselves cursed with at the moment.</p>

<p>To change the calendars that everyone uses right now (Exchange, Google, etc) is a big, hairy audacious ambition but it really, really needs doing. It&#8217;s just going to require a lot of small steps.</p>

<p>My focus now is on two things</p>

<!-- more -->


<ol>
<li>building a prototype to demonstrate servicing what I believe to be an initial, compelling use case</li>
<li>finding the founding team members</li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s the second of these that this post is about. The founding team I&#8217;m imagining is as follows.</p>

<h3>CEO (me)</h3>

<p>Product strategy, growth and ensuring there&#8217;s enough money in the bank (through timely fundraising and/or revenue generation).</p>

<h3>Back-end Ruby Developer</h3>

<p>This is a platform play so the working hypothesis is that an API first approach is critical to it&#8217;s ongoing success. The current implementation uses an event-sourced domain with a CQRS approach to the API. This is a real software engineering role.</p>

<h3>Front-end JavaScript Developer</h3>

<p>A rock solid, rich user experience delivered to web browsers is crucial to ensure people continue to use the service. No jQuery hacking, this is building a fully featured application that is hosted in the browser of all sorts of devices.</p>

<h3>Design, Branding and UX Designer</h3>

<p>The kind of data we&#8217;ll be holding for people is very private and thus we need to be sure that we interact with customers in way that both delights them and gives them confidence in us.</p>

<hr />

<p>The mode of operation will be a complete buzzword fest: agile, test-driven, continuously deployed, iterative, empircal decision making, constant learning. Anyone who knows me, or how Esendex operates, will know that these aren&#8217;t just words but are fundamental to how I try and operate.</p>

<p>Location is pretty open. I would love everyone to be within commuting distance of Nottingham but that just isn&#8217;t realistic if I want to work with the best people (and I do) so I&#8217;m looking at anywhere in the UK right now.</p>

<p>My plan/idea is to bring the team together for an intense period at the start (in Nottingham) and then we come together fortnightly for a retro on the previous iteration and to plan and start the next iteration. So being able to get to Nottingham without a crazy amount of hassle would probably be helpful.</p>

<p>Salary and options (with a proper earning and vesting schedule) for these roles. I&#8217;m seed funding this personally so salaries aren&#8217;t going to be crazy. You&#8217;ll definitely be able to earn more money doing something else but where would be the fun in that?</p>

<p>If you know someone who might fit please send them this post.</p>

<p>If you are that person then get in touch adam.bird [at] gmail.com and let&#8217;s see if we can make this happen.</p>

<p>What have I missed?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a strong correlation between having Hautacam on your TdF palmares and performance enhancement through drugs. I took the opposite approach and rode it with a mild hangover.</p>

<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://www.strava.com/activities/75540184/embed/58d175651805aebc2049b2bacecac14f3c4ac4d6'></iframe>


<p>I got chatting to a local cyclist at one of the campsite dinners who told me how beautiful this climb was. Also, the start of the climb was only about 8km from where we are staying so I couldn&#8217;t not do.</p>

<p>However, it turned out to be lot harder than I was anticipating.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The pattern of this climb is one of reported average gradients bearing little correlation to the actual gradients you experience.</p>

<p>A reported 8% km section is inevitably several flatter sections followed by ramps of more than 10%. For some reason I thought this climb got easier about halfway up but saw no evidence until in the final 2km. I was out of my saddle for more on this climb than any of the others I&#8217;d done in the Pyrenees over the last week.</p>

<p>The lower slopes are tree-lined and in morning shade that makes the torture slightly more bearable.</p>

<p>Around about 6km from the end the good stuff really starts to happen. Amazing views across the valleys that meet at Argeles-Gazost.</p>

<p>Across the Val d&#8217;Azun with the Soulor and Aubisque Cols at it&#8217;s head and the Pic des Tourettes, whose name entertained the schoolboy in me, towering over. And up towards Cauterets with Vignemale, the tallest mountain in the French Pyrenees. The ascent up to Hautacam being on the western side, these were all bathed in morning sun.</p>

<p>After a punishing 2km from around 5km to go things started to get easier and it&#8217;s possible to take in the view now the trees no longer line the road. I had the usual Pyrenean livestock to negotiate and the last km was an easy run round to the TdF finish.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adambird/9539109144/" title="Hautacam finish by adamebird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5485/9539109144_f49f3523c0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Hautacam finish"></a></p>

<p>What I then discovered, after taking the obligatory photo opp, was that there was still another 1.2km to go up to the top of Col de Tramessel. There you&#8217;ll find a refuge and the start of several Nordic ski routes and views over the other side of the Hautacam massif.</p>

<p>The descent was, again, brilliant. Lot&#8217;s more of accelerating out hairpins in the big ring and really feeling like you&#8217;re living the dream. I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that the real danger on Pyrenean descents is hitting some fresh livestock poo. Terrifying when you come hurtling round a bend and find shiny brown splodges across the road.</p>

<p>One more cycling day to go. I think I&#8217;m going to try something a little off the beaten track for my last excursion.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was Jérémy Roy</p>

<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://www.strava.com/activities/74848523/embed/79861b92c9d6541ca3dcc1db7597fbd8a0947e75'></iframe>


<p>The plan today was to take in both ascents of the Col du Tormalet. We&#8217;re staying close (20km) to the start of the west ascent so and out, up and over, and back seemed like a &#8216;sensible&#8217; plan.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The one challenge was the road closures due to the flood damage experienced earlier in the season between Barèges and Luz-Saint-Sauveur, the first section of the climb. The roads were closed from 08:00 to 12:00 and 13:30 to 17:30. So in order to make sure I was passed the roadworks before they closed I had to leave at 05:45 so I could descend back home during the lunchtime period.</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t so bad as it meant, after a ride to Luz in the dark, I had the climb to myself. It seemed no one else was fool as me. The climb starts pretty much straight out of Luz with 7-9% sections all the way up to Barèges. It was on this section that I discover the devastation the Le Bastan river had wraught. Fast melting, unusually high snow fall had ripped mercilessly through the valley tearing homes and roads apart.</p>

<p>As you go past 10km to go the road flattens to 5% which seems blessed relief at the time. As you round the bend at the end of the first flatter section you get a glimpse of your destination. The notch in the ridge ahead of you is the chairlift a few hundred metres south of the road pass itself.</p>

<p>After an easy section through the ski station at Super-Barèges things start to ramp up again and you can&#8217;t help feeling this is where it all starts to kick off when the Col is the destination for a summit finish. It&#8217;s at this point that the road painting starts to appear. Including a timely reminder that &#8216;pain is weakness leaving the body&#8217;.</p>

<p>More curious comes at around 5km to go when there is a Dutch section with names of national riders followed by what appears to be 500m of 1-3m long sperm. If I hadn&#8217;t been cycling I would have taken a photo so you&#8217;ll just have to believe me. Would love to know what it&#8217;s about.</p>

<p>Just at the end of the sperm, if you look up to your left you can see the observatory balanced precariously on the top of the Pic du Midi. Completely oblivious to your plight as all it&#8217;s attention is focused on the heavens.</p>

<p>2km is when it gets really serious. There&#8217;s a flat&#8217;ish section until a righthand hairpin at which point it&#8217;s a push skyward to the summit. Time to get into that pain cave and feel right at home as there is no respite now until the top. When you round the final lefthand hairpin under the chairlift any thoughts of an elegant, seated approach evaporate as the gradient, coupled with it&#8217;s position on the climb, require every muscle you can muster to overcome it.</p>

<p>I was alone on the Col at 08:30 when I arrived so a quick snap and straight down the other side to the ski resort at La Mongie, 4km below the Col, for what I hoped would be breakfast. Unfortunately all I could find open was a bar that was just serving coffee. A couple of short ones and I was off down what felt like would be the best descent of the day.</p>

<p>The 8km from La Mongie consisted of long straights and open corners that you could see through. I&#8217;m no dare-devil descender so didn&#8217;t push it, especially with some new wheels that I haven&#8217;t got used to yet, but I felt confident and enjoyed every minute of it. Maybe partly down to a masochistic pleasure taken in knowing I&#8217;d be coming back up shortly.</p>

<p>I stopped at Sainte-Marie de Campan, the start of the east ascent, turned straight around and started the ascent up. The first part is very easy, 3-4% easy, and at this point I was feeling pretty pleased with myself. One ascent done and feeling strong for the next one. Two things put pay to that confidence.</p>

<p>Firstly the sun. Although it was only around 10:00 this side of the valley was bathed in strong sunshine. The first climb had been in glorious, early morning shade. I&#8217;d taken great pleasure in watching as the sun first picked out the peaks on the opposite side of the valley and slowly crept down, illuminating them with a warm glow. This side was just unrelentingly hot. I remembered far more trees on the descent, though in reality the open sections just went past more quickly when I was hurtling down.</p>

<p>Secondly the climbing was quite different. This is purported to be the easier side but I found it a relentless 8-10% slog. Those long straights with open corners were reminiscent of the climb up Ventoux from Bedoin where there is no respite whatsoever for miles. I accept that I wasn&#8217;t necessarily approaching the climb with fresh legs but any dreams I had of arriving fresh at the top quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>As I approached La Mongie again I formed a loose agreement with a more senior French rider, sporting a local club&#8217;s jersey, a substantial grey mustache and astride a beautiful steel Colnago of some reasonable vintage. We worked together through and out of the inelegant architecture of the ski-station. It felt quite surreal with tourists arriving and going about their day, by now most things were open, as we laboured though the streets navigating the donkeys and goats that were hanging out like petulant teenagers.</p>

<p>When I said we worked together, what I meant was, I did what he did. This man who oozed cycling experience became my link to my purpose as I started to lose grip on reality a little. When he drank, I drank. When he got out of his saddle, I got out of my saddle.</p>

<p>With 3km to go, everything was hurting. What I thought had been the pain cave on the final 2km of the first ascent was actually a charming pied-a-tierre with sea views. Everything was hurting. I was having trouble focusing. I was empty. I was a pedalling automoton.</p>

<p>I finally lost his wheel on the last hairpin and found myself close to tears as walkers skipped gaily passed.</p>

<p>And then it was over. I was shaking. 2 cans of coke, a massive salad and a coffee as I sat bathed in sun outside the restaurant at the top soon restored me to some measure of health and sanity. Quick photo and then off down to make sure I made the lunchtime slot for the road reopening.</p>

<p>Another wonderful descent reminded me that I just love high mountain descents. There is something glorious about miles and miles of hurtling downhill.</p>

<p>The road from Luz to Argeles-Gazost, where we are staying, runs through a gorge and it&#8217;s here I had my Jérémy Roy moment. As I hurtled along the gorge through the rock-fall tunnels, pedalling furiously dragging the last drops of energy from my aching legs I felt like I was in a Pyrenean TDF stage. I been out on a breakaway in the high mountains all day, see Jérémy Roy in 2012 Tour, and was gunning for the finish in of the valley towns.</p>

<p>Then my back said don&#8217;t be so stupid, you&#8217;re 41 and somewhat out of condition.</p>

<p>Oh and there absolutely wasn&#8217;t a festival-come-market thing just below the Tourmalet on the west side that meant that roadworks and thus road closures had been suspended to ensure people could get to it.</p>

<p>So I needn&#8217;t have got up at 5:30 but I&#8217;m kinda glad I did.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around (<a href="../pushing-info-to-pebble-watch">see here</a>) and have set up a simple service that tweets me every morning at 7:30am with a simple weather forecast. Importantly it has the information I want as a cycle commuter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wind speed &amp; direction</li>
<li>Likelihood of rain</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<p>The result looks a bit like this</p>

<pre><code>@adambird
Mon 13 - BEESTON
11C Light rain
11mph WSW
Rain 84%
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s just one less thing to have to look at in the morning.</p>

<p>Would you like to receive the messages too?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got some ideas for developing it and if there&#8217;s enough interest I will. It doesn&#8217;t cost me anything to run other than time at the moment so I thought it was worth putting out there.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to give it a go. Then adam dot bird at gmail dot com or @adambird and let me know</p>

<ol>
<li>Where you want the forecast for</li>
<li>What time you want it</li>

<p>Also any thoughts on what info would be useful to you before you assemble your commuting accessories and attire would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://getpebble.com">Pebble Watch</a> finally arrived this week so I thought I should have a go at pushing information to it. As a cycle commuter I look at the weather every day and am primarily interested in wind direction and rain forecast so I though it would be neat to have this appear on my watch every morning.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> was the obvious place to start, especially as weather notifications are standard recipes. SMS or Twitter would be good channels to start but neither would work for me.</p>

<p>SMS just didn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;m in the UK on Orange. And Twitter wouldn&#8217;t allow sending a DM to myself (though as you&#8217;ll see from my solution I could have just done this).</p>

<p>I had heard reports of a Pebble push API but haven&#8217;t been able to find any documentation so I resorted to handcrafting my own solution.</p>

<h2>Pebblebot</h2>

<p>I created a simple Ruby command line script to handle the weather initially <a href="https://github.com/adambird/pebblebot">adambird/pebblebot</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve resorted to twitter DMs from another &#8216;bot&#8217; account I&#8217;ve created for the purpose. Not ideal as I end up with DMs on several devices which I don&#8217;t want. Once the Pebble Push API is available then this should be an easy swap out.</p>

<p>I host this on a Heroku at zero cost by having an app with no dynos and just a free <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/scheduler">Heroku Scheduler</a> that runs the script every morning.</p>

<p>At the moment this will need to be manually changed to daylight saving so I might need to thing of something more powerful for scheduling.</p>

<p>Have various ideas for improving and extending this, including making something that anyone could use. If you&#8217;re interested let me know what would be useful to you <a href="http://twitter.com/adambird">@adambird</a>.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve now added support for <a href="http://pushover.net">Pushover</a> and extended the command line options. See the <a href="https://github.com/adambird/pebblebot">adambird/pebblebot</a> for full details</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been put forward for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.frameworkha.org/jail_bail">Jail &amp; Bail</a> event in support of <a href="http://www.frameworkha.org">Framework</a> and I need your help (money).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.frameworkha.org">Framework</a> is the charity <a href="http://www.esendex.com">Esendex</a> are primarily working with and supporting. Their goal is to stop homelessness in all of it&#8217;s forms. What appealed to us the most about working with them was their approach to helping people get the support and training they need to enable them to change their own lives.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When you start talking to the team you begin to understand how perilously easy it would be for any of us to become homeless. But, also how tactical intervention and support can rescue people and allow them to participate and contribute to their community again.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re doing a number of things with Framework as a team from pure help to fundraising. It&#8217;s the latter that I&#8217;m currently involved in.</p>

<p>Jail &amp; Bail is a bit of fun designed to raise money for and profile of Framework. Myself and 5 other local people with profiles are being jailed for a variety of crimes.</p>

<p>Mine being <strong>&#8216;the gratuitous wearing of lycra in a public space&#8217;</strong>.</p>

<p>We will be tried, and in all likelihood, convicted in the courtroom of the Galleries of Justice on May 16th. From their we will be taken down to the cell/dungeon where we will stay until we raise £1000 &#8216;bail&#8217; money to be paid to Framework.</p>

<p>You can help keep me out of jail and help stop homelessness by donating on my <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/adambird-jailbail/">Just Giving page</a>. I urge you to do this sooner rather than later as 2 weeks is not a lot of time to raise £1000.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any support in spreading the word as well. Email your colleagues, click the twitter, facebook and Google+ links and do what you can for this important cause.</p>

<p>Framework&#8217;s mission is a crucial one if we want to build an economically successful city that celebrates and supports in equal measure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m an eternally frustrated user of computer and phone calendars. I find all sorts of aspects of using them clumsy and ill-suited to the way I work.</p>

<p>Am I the only one?</p>

<p>I have some ideas about how they could be improved but I only represent one perspective. If you use calendars and are within striking distance of either Nottingham or London I&#8217;d love to come and buy you a coffee.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Basically I&#8217;m looking for 15-20 mins of your time in which I&#8217;d like to understand how you currently use calendars and what your current pain points are. Where do you have to work round existing solutions in order to fit them into your way of working?</p>

<p>In return I can offer a warm, invigorating beverage and an empathetic ear as you unload your calendar related tales of woe. I might even throw in a muffin :)</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you&#8217;d be up for please get in touch <a href="http://twitter.com/adambird">@adambird</a> or <a href="mailto:adam.bird@gmail.com">adam.bird@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <id>http://www.adambird.com/only-entrepreneurs-can-lead-a-start-up-community</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m reading <a href="http://www.feld.com">Brad Feld&#8217;s</a> book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360061822&amp;sr=8-1">Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City</a> at the moment. It shares his ideas and experience from being keenly involved in establishing the start-up community in Boulder, Colorado.</p>

<p>One of his key assertions is that entrepreneurs must lead such a community:</p>

<blockquote><p>The most critical principle of a startup community is that entrepreneurs must lead it. Lots of different people are involved in the startup community and many nonentrepreneurs play key roles. Unless the entrepreneurs lead, the startup community will not be sustainable over time.</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>He goes on to say</p>

<blockquote><p>I define an entrepreneur as someone who has co-founded a company. I differentiate between &#8220;high-growth entrepreneurial companies&#8221; and &#8220;small businesses&#8221;. Both are important, but they are different things.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later in the book he describes how half a dozen such people &#8220;ignited the entrepreneurial revolution&#8221; on Boulder. A city of 250k people. Nottingham has around 800k.</p>

<p>If you follow Brad&#8217;s assertion then in order for the Creative Quarter project to create sustainable economic development driven by new ambitious businesses then those of us leading high-growth businesses need to take responsibility for it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re one of those people, please get in touch.</p>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or not, if you want to be part of making this initative successful, I&#8217;d recommend reading the book.</p>

<p>Are you a developer? Are you a business owner who employs developers? Have you heard about<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk"> CodeClub</a>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Code Club is a nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged 9-11. The mission is&nbsp;to give every child in the UK the chance to learn to code. The&nbsp;aim to have a Code Club in 25% of primary schools in the UK by the end of 2014.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s not to like about being part of that.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A new term is about to start so I urge you to contact your local primary school, either local to home or work, and volunteer to run a club for a term. All the materials are made available by Code Club so it&#8217;s super easy.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a developer you just have to inspire hungry young minds.</p>

<p>If you employ developers then this a perfect personal development opportunity for your team and a real opportunity for you to give something to your community.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in Nottingham then get in touch with me (<a href="mailto:adam.bird@esendex.com">adam.bird@esendex.com</a>) as the City Council are very, very keen to find ways they can help local employers to make this happen.</p>

<p>So, to summarise</p>

<ul>
<li>Go here&nbsp;<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/">http://codeclub.org.uk/</a></li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
<li>Inspire the next generation</li>

    <updated>2012-07-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambird.com/the-nottingham-creative-quarter-what-can-you</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The announcement of Nottingham&#8217;s City Deal last week (<a href="http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files_dpm/resources/Nottingham-City-Deal-final.pdf">http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files_dpm/resources/Nottingham-City-Deal-final.pdf</a>) is big deal for entrepreneurship in the city. The council now have the funds and powers to provide the infrastructure and support to the new, innovative businesses that will drive GDP growth in the city and provide the skilled jobs going forward.</p>

<p>But, infrastructure is only one part of the jigsaw. I want to share a couple of thoughts on how we, the business community in Nottingham, can do our bit to support our city in this endeavour.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The incubator without walls concept is predicated on building a sense community among the businesses in the city centre. One where we all come together to share, help and learn from each other for the mutual benefit of us all.</p>

<p>We already have a vibrant community with events like Nott Tuesday, Second Wednesday, GeekUp and Game City Nights bringing people together on a regular basis. All of these events could be bigger and better though. You can support them by attending, encouraging your team to attend, mining your contact book for speakers or your or your team speaking and giving the rest of the community the benefit of your experiences.&lt;/</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t just altruism. This will help you be more successful.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re at the coal-face of a small business growing hard or running to stand still as is the case for many, it&#8217;s easy to shut out distractions. I know exactly what it is like. However, taking time out to share and reflect is invariably valuable. Not only does it ive you some mental space to reset your thought processes you may find someone with similar challenges who, if they haven&#8217;t already solved them and can share their solution, can provide a valuable ally.</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re to build a sustainable future for the city, we need to develop the skills of our young people. This doesn&#8217;t have to be the prevail of large organisations with training schemes and huge CSR budgets. If we really want to empower young people to take control of the learning and inspire them to greatness, they need the opportunity to experience working with small organisations as well.</p>

<p>The challenge for small companies is that when this young, untrained, person represents 20% of your workforce that is a huge risk. The way to assuage that risk is to do what you can, and consider that it&#8217;s probably more than you&#8217;re doing at the moment.</p>

<p>Code Club (<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk">http://codeclub.org.uk</a>) is a great initiative to start introducing children to software development at after school clubs. If you have developers encourage and support them to run a Code Club at their local school, whether they have children or not.</p>

<p>Contact local colleges and explain you can host one or two students on Tuesdays (for example) or encourage your marketing exec to run workshops to show how what they&#8217;re learning now is actually applied in the real world.</p>

<p>My experience of recruiting over the years is seeing a widening disconnect between what is being taught to pass exams and what we as businesses actually do on a daily basis. Colleges like New College Nottingham (<a href="http://www.ncn.ac.uk/content/home.aspx">http://www.ncn.ac.uk/content/home.aspx</a>) have recognised this and are actively looking to engage with the business community to help them solve this.</p>

<p>Again this isn&#8217;t blind altruism. The personal development benefits to mentors are well documented. The business gets to hone a new employee at a fraction of the cost. The city benefits are just a by product.</p>

<p>There will be all sorts of other ways we can all come together to support the vision of Nottingham as a rewarding and enjoyable place to live and work. If the last few years have taught us anything, it&#8217;s that greed and selfishness is road to destruction.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s learn from that and work together to build something sustainable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This caused me a bit of heartache and I found little to help via the usual channels.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d upgraded a Rails 2 app that used Delayed_Job to Rails 3 and was deploying the Heroku Cedar stack. Jobs were being queued but would fail immediately when trying to deserialise with</p>

<pre><code>uninitialized constant Syck::Syck
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>when trying to parse and initialise the handler. Irritatingly the worker logs were showing the jobs as successful.</p>

<p>After messing around with trying to explicitly set the YAML parser in <code>config/boot.rb</code> I found the solution.</p>

<p><code>Syck</code> isn&#8217;t available on the Heroku Cedar stack so you have to include the <code>Psych</code> gem.</p>

<pre><code>gem 'pysch'
</code></pre>

<p>I then ran this on the console to resubmit the jobs and all was good</p>

<pre><code>Delayed::Job.all.each do |job| job.invoke_job ; job.destroy end

    <link href="http://www.adambird.com/decoupling-the-domain-from-the-interface-with"/>
    <updated>2012-05-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambird.com/decoupling-the-domain-from-the-interface-with</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MVC (model-view-controller) is a well established pattern for developing web applications which I&#8217;ve used with both Rails and ASP.NET. Both of these frameworks provide powerful interface add-ons, for example validations, with which you can decorate your models and let the framework do a lot of heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;ve found that using these can lead to a leaky coupling between domain and UI logic which slowly and inexorably adds complexity and maintainability headaches.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started using a new approach that I&#8217;m finding more flexible but has enough pragmatism to leverage the framework hooks and features.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Treat the web app as an API</h3>

<p>Whatever you do, make the web application url scheme work with resources. For example if you need to expose a password reset feature you would do the following</p>

<pre><code>POST /password_resets
</code></pre>

<p>You would then provide a link to the created password reset request in an email</p>

<pre><code>GET /password_resets/wieurh2398hf38h83h028f2=f92-0fw0f
</code></pre>

<p>The the user would then submit a new password with</p>

<pre><code>PUT /password_resets/wieurh2398hf38h83h028f2=f92-0fw0f
</code></pre>

<p>All good so far. But here&#8217;s the next stage</p>

<h3>Resources are not necessarily domain objects</h3>

<p>When I create a password reset request I&#8217;m not actually creating a record in a database somewhere, I&#8217;m actually performing an operation on a User domain object to append a random token that I can use to look up the user record when the user clicks on the link.</p>

<pre><code>class User
  def create_password_reset_token(at)
    password_reset_token = SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64
    password_reset_token_expires_at = at.utc + (60*60*24)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Enter the method object. For this interaction I need two. CreatePasswordReset and ResetPassword.</p>

<pre><code>class CreatePasswordReset
  attr_accessor :user_id

  def execute(at)
    user = user_store.get(user_id)
    user.create_password_reset(at)
    user_store.save(user)
  end
end

class ResetPassword
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  attr_accessor :token, :password, :password_confirmation

  validate :password, :presence =&amp;gt; true   
  validate :password, :confirmation =&amp;gt; true    

  def execute(at)
    if valid?       
      user = user_store.get_by_token(token)       
      user.set_password(password)       
      user_store.save(user)     
    end   
  end 
end
</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding controller methods are super simple as they just treat the result of the execute method as a binary result.</p>

<pre><code>class PasswordResetController &amp;lt; ApplicationController   
  def update     
    command = ResetPassword.new(params[:reset_password])     
    if command.execute(current_time)       
      redirect_to account_path, :notice =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;We've updated your password&amp;quot;     
    else       
      render :edit     
    end   
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The result is</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a web api that maps to operations that a user wants to perform and domain that maps to the entities in my business system.</li>
<li>I have very simple controllers that delegate the domain interactions to method objects that understand the required interactions.</li>
<li>I leverage the validation helpers provided by the framework without polluting my domain with UI detail</li>
</ul>


<p>I do appreciate that validation logic is actually domain logic but this pattern allows a pragmatic allocation of responsibilities in order to increase productivity.</p>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<p><strong>Controllers</strong> to ensure only authorised users can perform operations on the domain</p>

<p><strong>Method Objects</strong> to ensure domain interactions are valid and well formed.</p>

<p><strong>Models</strong> to model the domain irrespective of how it&#8217;s being interacted with.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <id>http://www.adambird.com/my-two-penneth-on-the-2012-budget</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The most disappointing announcement for me was that Nottingham has missed out on it&#8217;s bid for the Super Connected Cities fund. It&#8217;s a real shame for the city. There was an additional, smaller, fund announced so hopefully the bid team can dust themselves off and we can go again.</p>

<p>Much was made the day before the budget about discounted lending for small businesses, ie those with less than &pound;50m turnover. This is an amendment to the existing Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme where the government underwrites this lending, protecting the banks.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>What hasn&#8217;t changed are the rules around lending. So it will only be beneficial if the problem is the cost of credit rather than access to credit for small companies. Unfortunately what am seeing is a problem with the latter rather than the former. I would have liked to have seen more focus on making finance and mentorship available to first time entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>I believe that the Chancellor has taken a fairly big gamble with taxation. He&#8217;s reducing the taxes of the wealthiest in our society, both personal and corporate, with the hypothesis that this will stimulate investment and spending. It will be very hard to judge whether this has had a directly attributable effect whatever the outcome.</p>

<p>Esendex and it&#8217;s team members are probably broadly better off as a result of this budget. Whether the country is, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>This leaves us with an important responsibility. We must continuing growing, exporting and investing so that we can further contribute to our local economy and community.</p>

    <id>http://www.adambird.com/api-divining-with-cucumber-and-firefox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been discovering the wonders of <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a> and <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> recently (I know, I know, I&#8217;m horribly late to that particular party) and revelling in how the BDD &gt; TDD cycle helps keep one focused on the feature being delivered.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Rest APIs</a> are a common topic of conversation among the <a href="http://www.esendex.com">Esendex</a> dev team and it was a conversation with @jbjon and @samwessel this week that inspired an experiment.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We were discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> whereby a REST client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. Your API shouldn&#8217;t be fixed but should be discoverable. Clients shouldn&#8217;t be locked into a tight coupling with your API but should be able to adapt has it changes.</p>

<p>What also came up was the notion that the mark of a well tested system was that you could through away all of your code and be confident that you could rebuild it completely based on the tests.</p>

<p>So I set myself an exercise. Could I build an API by putting myself in the shoes of a developer discovering the API for the first time. My tools Cucumber and Firefox.</p>
