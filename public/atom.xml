    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m an eternally frustrated user of computer and phone calendars. I find all sorts of aspects of using them clumsy and ill-suited to the way I work.</p>

<p>Am I the only one?</p>

<p>I have some ideas about how they could be improved but I only represent one perspective. If you use calendars and are within striking distance of either Nottingham or London I&#8217;d love to come and buy you a coffee.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Basically I&#8217;m looking for 15-20 mins of your time in which I&#8217;d like to understand how you currently use calendars and what your current pain points are. Where do you have to work round existing solutions in order to fit them into your way of working?</p>

<p>In return I can offer a warm, invigorating beverage and an empathetic ear as you unload your calendar related tales of woe. I might even throw in a muffin :)</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you&#8217;d be up for please get in touch <a href="http://twitter.com/adambird">@adambird</a> or <a href="mailto:adam.bird@gmail.com">adam.bird@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <id>http://www.adambird.com/only-entrepreneurs-can-lead-a-start-up-community</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m reading <a href="http://www.feld.com">Brad Feld&#8217;s</a> book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360061822&amp;sr=8-1">Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City</a> at the moment. It shares his ideas and experience from being keenly involved in establishing the start-up community in Boulder, Colorado.</p>

<p>One of his key assertions is that entrepreneurs must lead such a community:</p>

<blockquote><p>The most critical principle of a startup community is that entrepreneurs must lead it. Lots of different people are involved in the startup community and many nonentrepreneurs play key roles. Unless the entrepreneurs lead, the startup community will not be sustainable over time.</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>He goes on to say</p>

<blockquote><p>I define an entrepreneur as someone who has co-founded a company. I differentiate between &#8220;high-growth entrepreneurial companies&#8221; and &#8220;small businesses&#8221;. Both are important, but they are different things.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later in the book he describes how half a dozen such people &#8220;ignited the entrepreneurial revolution&#8221; on Boulder. A city of 250k people. Nottingham has around 800k.</p>

<p>If you follow Brad&#8217;s assertion then in order for the Creative Quarter project to create sustainable economic development driven by new ambitious businesses then those of us leading high-growth businesses need to take responsibility for it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re one of those people, please get in touch.</p>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or not, if you want to be part of making this initative successful, I&#8217;d recommend reading the book.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.adambird.com/images/code-club-logo.png" alt="" width="180px"/></p>

<p>Are you a developer? Are you a business owner who employs developers? Have you heard about<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk"> CodeClub</a>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Code Club is a nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged 9-11. The mission is&nbsp;to give every child in the UK the chance to learn to code. The&nbsp;aim to have a Code Club in 25% of primary schools in the UK by the end of 2014.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s not to like about being part of that.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A new term is about to start so I urge you to contact your local primary school, either local to home or work, and volunteer to run a club for a term. All the materials are made available by Code Club so it&#8217;s super easy.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a developer you just have to inspire hungry young minds.</p>

<p>If you employ developers then this a perfect personal development opportunity for your team and a real opportunity for you to give something to your community.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in Nottingham then get in touch with me (<a href="mailto:adam.bird@esendex.com">adam.bird@esendex.com</a>) as the City Council are very, very keen to find ways they can help local employers to make this happen.</p>

<p>So, to summarise</p>

<ul>
<li>Go here&nbsp;<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/">http://codeclub.org.uk/</a></li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
<li>Inspire the next generation</li>

    <updated>2012-07-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambird.com/the-nottingham-creative-quarter-what-can-you</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The announcement of Nottingham&#8217;s City Deal last week (<a href="http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files_dpm/resources/Nottingham-City-Deal-final.pdf">http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files_dpm/resources/Nottingham-City-Deal-final.pdf</a>) is big deal for entrepreneurship in the city. The council now have the funds and powers to provide the infrastructure and support to the new, innovative businesses that will drive GDP growth in the city and provide the skilled jobs going forward.</p>

<p>But, infrastructure is only one part of the jigsaw. I want to share a couple of thoughts on how we, the business community in Nottingham, can do our bit to support our city in this endeavour.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The incubator without walls concept is predicated on building a sense community among the businesses in the city centre. One where we all come together to share, help and learn from each other for the mutual benefit of us all.</p>

<p>We already have a vibrant community with events like Nott Tuesday, Second Wednesday, GeekUp and Game City Nights bringing people together on a regular basis. All of these events could be bigger and better though. You can support them by attending, encouraging your team to attend, mining your contact book for speakers or your or your team speaking and giving the rest of the community the benefit of your experiences.&lt;/</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t just altruism. This will help you be more successful.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re at the coal-face of a small business growing hard or running to stand still as is the case for many, it&#8217;s easy to shut out distractions. I know exactly what it is like. However, taking time out to share and reflect is invariably valuable. Not only does it ive you some mental space to reset your thought processes you may find someone with similar challenges who, if they haven&#8217;t already solved them and can share their solution, can provide a valuable ally.</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re to build a sustainable future for the city, we need to develop the skills of our young people. This doesn&#8217;t have to be the prevail of large organisations with training schemes and huge CSR budgets. If we really want to empower young people to take control of the learning and inspire them to greatness, they need the opportunity to experience working with small organisations as well.</p>

<p>The challenge for small companies is that when this young, untrained, person represents 20% of your workforce that is a huge risk. The way to assuage that risk is to do what you can, and consider that it&#8217;s probably more than you&#8217;re doing at the moment.</p>

<p>Code Club (<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk">http://codeclub.org.uk</a>) is a great initiative to start introducing children to software development at after school clubs. If you have developers encourage and support them to run a Code Club at their local school, whether they have children or not.</p>

<p>Contact local colleges and explain you can host one or two students on Tuesdays (for example) or encourage your marketing exec to run workshops to show how what they&#8217;re learning now is actually applied in the real world.</p>

<p>My experience of recruiting over the years is seeing a widening disconnect between what is being taught to pass exams and what we as businesses actually do on a daily basis. Colleges like New College Nottingham (<a href="http://www.ncn.ac.uk/content/home.aspx">http://www.ncn.ac.uk/content/home.aspx</a>) have recognised this and are actively looking to engage with the business community to help them solve this.</p>

<p>Again this isn&#8217;t blind altruism. The personal development benefits to mentors are well documented. The business gets to hone a new employee at a fraction of the cost. The city benefits are just a by product.</p>

<p>There will be all sorts of other ways we can all come together to support the vision of Nottingham as a rewarding and enjoyable place to live and work. If the last few years have taught us anything, it&#8217;s that greed and selfishness is road to destruction.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s learn from that and work together to build something sustainable.</p>

    <id>http://www.adambird.com/delayedjob-syck-woes-when-deploying-to-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This caused me a bit of heartache and I found little to help via the usual channels.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d upgraded a Rails 2 app that used Delayed_Job to Rails 3 and was deploying the Heroku Cedar stack. Jobs were being queued but would fail immediately when trying to deserialise with</p>

<pre><code>uninitialized constant Syck::Syck
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>when trying to parse and initialise the handler. Irritatingly the worker logs were showing the jobs as successful.</p>

<p>After messing around with trying to explicitly set the YAML parser in <code>config/boot.rb</code> I found the solution.</p>

<p><code>Syck</code> isn&#8217;t available on the Heroku Cedar stack so you have to include the <code>Psych</code> gem.</p>

<pre><code>gem 'pysch'
</code></pre>

<p>I then ran this on the console to resubmit the jobs and all was good</p>

<pre><code>Delayed::Job.all.each do |job| job.invoke_job ; job.destroy end

    <link href="http://www.adambird.com/decoupling-the-domain-from-the-interface-with"/>
    <updated>2012-05-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambird.com/decoupling-the-domain-from-the-interface-with</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MVC (model-view-controller) is a well established pattern for developing web applications which I&#8217;ve used with both Rails and ASP.NET. Both of these frameworks provide powerful interface add-ons, for example validations, with which you can decorate your models and let the framework do a lot of heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;ve found that using these can lead to a leaky coupling between domain and UI logic which slowly and inexorably adds complexity and maintainability headaches.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started using a new approach that I&#8217;m finding more flexible but has enough pragmatism to leverage the framework hooks and features.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Treat the web app as an API</h3>

<p>Whatever you do, make the web application url scheme work with resources. For example if you need to expose a password reset feature you would do the following</p>

<pre><code>POST /password_resets
</code></pre>

<p>You would then provide a link to the created password reset request in an email</p>

<pre><code>GET /password_resets/wieurh2398hf38h83h028f2=f92-0fw0f
</code></pre>

<p>The the user would then submit a new password with</p>

<pre><code>PUT /password_resets/wieurh2398hf38h83h028f2=f92-0fw0f
</code></pre>

<p>All good so far. But here&#8217;s the next stage</p>

<h3>Resources are not necessarily domain objects</h3>

<p>When I create a password reset request I&#8217;m not actually creating a record in a database somewhere, I&#8217;m actually performing an operation on a User domain object to append a random token that I can use to look up the user record when the user clicks on the link.</p>

<pre><code>class User
  def create_password_reset_token(at)
    password_reset_token = SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64
    password_reset_token_expires_at = at.utc + (60*60*24)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Enter the method object. For this interaction I need two. CreatePasswordReset and ResetPassword.</p>

<pre><code>class CreatePasswordReset
  attr_accessor :user_id

  def execute(at)
    user = user_store.get(user_id)
    user.create_password_reset(at)
    user_store.save(user)
  end
end

class ResetPassword
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  attr_accessor :token, :password, :password_confirmation

  validate :password, :presence =&amp;gt; true   
  validate :password, :confirmation =&amp;gt; true    

  def execute(at)
    if valid?       
      user = user_store.get_by_token(token)       
      user.set_password(password)       
      user_store.save(user)     
    end   
  end 
end
</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding controller methods are super simple as they just treat the result of the execute method as a binary result.</p>

<pre><code>class PasswordResetController &amp;lt; ApplicationController   
  def update     
    command = ResetPassword.new(params[:reset_password])     
    if command.execute(current_time)       
      redirect_to account_path, :notice =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;We've updated your password&amp;quot;     
    else       
      render :edit     
    end   
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The result is</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a web api that maps to operations that a user wants to perform and domain that maps to the entities in my business system.</li>
<li>I have very simple controllers that delegate the domain interactions to method objects that understand the required interactions.</li>
<li>I leverage the validation helpers provided by the framework without polluting my domain with UI detail</li>
</ul>


<p>I do appreciate that validation logic is actually domain logic but this pattern allows a pragmatic allocation of responsibilities in order to increase productivity.</p>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<p><strong>Controllers</strong> to ensure only authorised users can perform operations on the domain</p>

<p><strong>Method Objects</strong> to ensure domain interactions are valid and well formed.</p>

<p><strong>Models</strong> to model the domain irrespective of how it&#8217;s being interacted with.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <id>http://www.adambird.com/my-two-penneth-on-the-2012-budget</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The most disappointing announcement for me was that Nottingham has missed out on it&#8217;s bid for the Super Connected Cities fund. It&#8217;s a real shame for the city. There was an additional, smaller, fund announced so hopefully the bid team can dust themselves off and we can go again.</p>

<p>Much was made the day before the budget about discounted lending for small businesses, ie those with less than &pound;50m turnover. This is an amendment to the existing Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme where the government underwrites this lending, protecting the banks.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>What hasn&#8217;t changed are the rules around lending. So it will only be beneficial if the problem is the cost of credit rather than access to credit for small companies. Unfortunately what am seeing is a problem with the latter rather than the former. I would have liked to have seen more focus on making finance and mentorship available to first time entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>I believe that the Chancellor has taken a fairly big gamble with taxation. He&#8217;s reducing the taxes of the wealthiest in our society, both personal and corporate, with the hypothesis that this will stimulate investment and spending. It will be very hard to judge whether this has had a directly attributable effect whatever the outcome.</p>

<p>Esendex and it&#8217;s team members are probably broadly better off as a result of this budget. Whether the country is, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>This leaves us with an important responsibility. We must continuing growing, exporting and investing so that we can further contribute to our local economy and community.</p>

    <id>http://www.adambird.com/api-divining-with-cucumber-and-firefox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been discovering the wonders of <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a> and <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> recently (I know, I know, I&#8217;m horribly late to that particular party) and revelling in how the BDD &gt; TDD cycle helps keep one focused on the feature being delivered.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Rest APIs</a> are a common topic of conversation among the <a href="http://www.esendex.com">Esendex</a> dev team and it was a conversation with @jbjon and @samwessel this week that inspired an experiment.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We were discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> whereby a REST client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. Your API shouldn&#8217;t be fixed but should be discoverable. Clients shouldn&#8217;t be locked into a tight coupling with your API but should be able to adapt has it changes.</p>

<p>What also came up was the notion that the mark of a well tested system was that you could through away all of your code and be confident that you could rebuild it completely based on the tests.</p>

<p>So I set myself an exercise. Could I build an API by putting myself in the shoes of a developer discovering the API for the first time. My tools Cucumber and Firefox.</p>

    <updated>2011-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambird.com/the-big-m-went-bold-and-got-it-so-right</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was at the Big M mobile conference (<a href="http://thebigm.mobi/)">http://thebigm.mobi/)</a> on Monday and am very glad I was. Chris (<a href="http://twitter.com/bookmeister">@bookmeister</a>) and Mike (<a href="http://twitter.com/m1ke_ellis">@m1ke_ellis</a>) made some bold decisions in putting on this event and they paid off. <p /> <span style="font-size: medium;">Bold Decision #1 - Bath </span><p /> Tech innovation and Somerset are not necessarily two words I would associate but they absolutely showed the rest of the country what a great scene exists there. Nottingham (where I live and work) could learn a lot. It is a beautiful city that is a joy to visit. In the battle for talent that cities are (or should be) engaged in now, they have served Bath well. <p /> <span style="font-size: medium;">Bold Decision #2 - No WiFi </span><p /> Didn&#8217;t miss it, in fact I&#8217;m glad it wasn&#8217;t there. The mobile signal was good enough to get emails if anything urgent cropped up. I would imagine this was one of the reasons why people talked to each other more and probably got more out of the speakers. I go to too many conferences these days where people are too busy, surfing, and interacting with people that aren&#8217;t there rather than engaging with the speakers. <p /> <span style="font-size: medium;">Bold Decision #3 - Price</span> <p /> &pound;200 for a one day conference seemed reasonably pricey and pitching this right would have been a really hand wringer but it was spot on. It meant everyone who came really wanted to get something out of it and I&#8217;m guessing it meant they could afford the calibre of speakers that they attracted. <p /> <span style="font-size: medium;">Bold Decision #4 - Comedy/Rock Club Venue</span> <p /> Forget anonymous hotels or convention facilities, more events like this should be held in this kind of venue. Komedia (<a href="http://www.komedia.co.uk/)">http://www.komedia.co.uk/)</a> had all the facilities and looked fantastic. People arrived and there was a palpable buzz as they went through the door into the venue proper. Going to a gig for &#8216;work&#8217;, brilliant. It was especially entertaining watching as a bunch of geeks spilled out on to streets at the breaks, blinking as they readjusted to a bright and very real world still existing outside. <p />  <br />If they run it next year I will absolutely be going as should you. <p /></p>

    <link href="http://www.adambird.com/lets-show-graduates-what-nottingham-can-offer"/>
    <updated>2011-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambird.com/lets-show-graduates-what-nottingham-can-offer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think it&#8217;s time we showed graduates and under-graduates that Nottingham not only represents a great place to get an education but also a fantastic city in which to build a life and career. We have some great creative and tech companies in the city crying out for talented people to join their successful teams. We need to connect people with these opportunities before they depart for more &#8216;traditional&#8217; destinations.</p>

<p>To do this, I&#8217;m running a recruitment event for internships, work placements and graduate positions in the creative and tech companies of Nottingham.</p>

<p>Before you run a mile with visions of milk-rounds and corporate presentations I&#8217;m going to set it up it in a way that better reflects how we, the new wave of businesses in the city, operate.</p>

<p>While I appreciate that we&#8217;re all often in &#8216;competition&#8217; for the best talent we can get, a collaborative approach will reap for more benefits for us all. Let&#8217;s level the playing field a little and work together to represent Nottingham to the next generation of talented individuals so they can join us in changing our own particular worlds.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the, current, plan</p>

<ol>
<li>Contribution to the costs are in proportion to the employers size. I&#8217;m looking for a couple of larger organisations to underwrite the event (Esendex will be one) in order that we can get it up and running. Current thinking is: 1-5 employees &pound;75, 6-15 &pound;150, 16-30 &pound;300, 30+ &pound;600.</li>
<li>No presentations, no formal standing up in front of a room full of candidates. Each employer will be represented by a number of existing team members (in proportion to the number of opportunities/size) there to discuss them with the prospects. </li>
<li>Venue will probably be something like Antenna and the costs are to put money behind the bar and some simple catering.</li>
<li>Promotion is through word of mouth, contacts, social media and every other way we all know how. Of course the success of the event will rely on everyone knowing about it.</li>
<li>Participation numbers (both employers and candidates) will controlled and ticketed, using Amiando probably</li>
<li>I&#8217;m looking at April as the best time to run it.</li>
</ol>


<p>Firstly, let me know what you think. What have I missed, what could be improved, what help can you give in promotion? Please use the comments so we can have a discussion.</p>

<p>Secondly if you can offer opportunities to graduates or under-grads then come direct: <a href="mailto:adam.bird@esendex.com">adam.bird@esendex.com</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/adambird">@adambird</a></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve started something in Nottingham, let&#8217;s push it to the next level.</p>
