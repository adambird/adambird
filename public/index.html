<p>Are you a developer? Are you a business owner who employs developers? Have you heard about<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk"> CodeClub</a>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Code Club is a nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged 9-11. The mission is&nbsp;to give every child in the UK the chance to learn to code. The&nbsp;aim to have a Code Club in 25% of primary schools in the UK by the end of 2014.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s not to like about being part of that.</p>

<p>A new term is about to start so I urge you to contact your local primary school, either local to home or work, and volunteer to run a club for a term. All the materials are made available by Code Club so it&#8217;s super easy.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a developer you just have to inspire hungry young minds.</p>

<p>If you employ developers then this a perfect personal development opportunity for your team and a real opportunity for you to give something to your community.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in Nottingham then get in touch with me (<a href="mailto:adam.bird@esendex.com">adam.bird@esendex.com</a>) as the City Council are very, very keen to find ways they can help local employers to make this happen.</p>

<p>So, to summarise</p>

<ul>
<li>Go here <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/">http://codeclub.org.uk/</a></li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
<li>Inspire the next generation</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>The announcement of Nottingham&#8217;s City Deal last week (<a href="http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files_dpm/resources/Nottingham-City-Deal-final.pdf">http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files_dpm/resources/Nottingham-City-Deal-final.pdf</a>) is big deal for entrepreneurship in the city.&nbsp;The council now have the funds and powers to provide the infrastructure and support to the new, innovative businesses that will drive GDP growth in the city and provide the skilled jobs going forward.</div>


<p /><div>But, infrastructure is only one part of the jigsaw. I want to share a couple of thoughts on how we, the business community in Nottingham, can do our bit to support our city in this endeavour.</div><p />The incubator without walls concept is predicated on building a sense community among the businesses in the city centre. One where we all come together to share, help and learn from each other for the mutual benefit of us all.<p /><div>We already have a vibrant community with events like Nott Tuesday, Second Wednesday, GeekUp and Game City Nights bringing people together on a regular basis. All of these events could be bigger and better though. You can support them by attending, encouraging your team to attend, mining your contact book for speakers or your or your team speaking and giving the rest of the community the benefit of your experiences.</div><p /><div>This isn&#8217;t just altruism. This will help you be more successful.</div><p /><div>When you&#8217;re at the coal-face of a small business growing hard or running to stand still as is the case for many, it&#8217;s easy to shut out distractions. I know exactly what it is like. However, taking time out to share and reflect is invariably valuable. Not only does it ive you some mental space to reset your thought processes you may find someone with similar challenges who, if they haven&#8217;t already solved them and can share their solution, can provide a valuable ally.</div><p /><div>If we&#8217;re to build a sustainable future for the city, we need to develop the skills of our young people. This doesn&#8217;t have to be the prevail of large organisations with training schemes and huge CSR budgets. If we really want to empower young people to take control of the learning and inspire them to greatness, they need the opportunity to experience working with small organisations as well.</div><p /><div>The challenge for small companies is that when this young, untrained, person represents 20% of your workforce that is a huge risk. The way to assuage that risk is to do what you can, and consider that it&#8217;s probably more than you&#8217;re doing at the moment.&nbsp;</div><p /><div>Code Club (<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk">http://codeclub.org.uk</a>) is a great initiative to start introducing children to software development at after school clubs. If you have developers encourage and support them to run a Code Club at their local school, whether they have children or not.&nbsp;</div><p /><div>Contact local colleges and explain you can host one or two students on Tuesdays (for example) or encourage your marketing exec to run workshops to show how what they&#8217;re learning now is actually applied in the real world.</div><p /><div>My experience of recruiting over the years is seeing a widening disconnect between what is being taught to pass exams and what we as businesses actually do on a daily basis. Colleges like New College Nottingham (<a href="http://www.ncn.ac.uk/content/home.aspx">http://www.ncn.ac.uk/content/home.aspx</a>) have recognised this and are actively looking to engage with the business community to help them solve this.&nbsp;</div><p /><div>Again this isn&#8217;t blind altruism. The personal development benefits to mentors are well documented. The business gets to hone a new employee at a fraction of the cost. The city benefits are just a by product.</div><p /><div>There will be all sorts of other ways we can all come together to support the vision of Nottingham as a rewarding and enjoyable place to live and work. If the last few years have taught us anything, it&#8217;s that greed and selfishness is road to destruction.</div><p /><div>Let&#8217;s learn from that and work together to build something sustainable.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This caused me a bit of heartache and I found little to help via the usual channels.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d upgraded a Rails 2 app that used Delayed_Job to Rails 3 and was deploying the Heroku Cedar stack. Jobs were being queued but would fail immediately when trying to deserialise with</p>

<pre><code>uninitialized constant Syck::Syck
</code></pre>

<p>when trying to parse and initialise the handler. Irritatingly the worker logs were showing the jobs as successful.</p>

<p>After messing around with trying to explicitly set the YAML parser in <code>config/boot.rb</code> I found the solution.</p>

<p><code>Syck</code> isn&#8217;t available on the Heroku Cedar stack so you have to include the <code>Psych</code> gem.</p>

<pre><code>gem 'pysch'
</code></pre>

<p>I then ran this on the console to resubmit the jobs and all was good</p>

<pre><code>Delayed::Job.all.each do |job| job.invoke_job ; job.destroy end
</code></pre>

<time datetime="2012-05-08T10:07:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 8<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>MVC (model-view-controller) is a well established pattern for developing web applications which I&#8217;ve used with both Rails and ASP.NET. Both of these frameworks provide powerful interface add-ons, for example validations, with which you can decorate your models and let the framework do a lot of heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;ve found that using these can lead to a leaky coupling between domain and UI logic which slowly and inexorably adds complexity and maintainability headaches.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started using a new approach that I&#8217;m finding more flexible but has enough pragmatism to leverage the framework hooks and features.</p>

<h3>Treat the web app as an API</h3>


<p>Whatever you do, make the web application url scheme work with resources. For example if you need to expose a password reset feature you would do the following</p>

<p><code>POST /password_resets</code></p>

<p>You would then provide a link to the created password reset request in an email</p>

<p><code>GET /password_resets/wieurh2398hf38h83h028f2=f92-0fw0f</code></p>

<p>The the user would then submit a new password with</p>

<p><code>PUT /password_resets/wieurh2398hf38h83h028f2=f92-0fw0f</code></p>

<p>All good so far. But here&#8217;s the next stage</p>

<h3>Resources are not necessarily domain objects</h3>


<p>When I create a password reset request I&#8217;m not actually creating a record in a database somewhere, I&#8217;m actually performing an operation on a User domain object to append a random token that I can use to look up the user record when the user clicks on the link.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>class User
  def create_password_reset_token(at)
    password_reset_token = SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64
    password_reset_token_expires_at = at.utc + (60*60*24)
  end
end</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Enter the method object. For this interaction I need two. CreatePasswordReset and ResetPassword.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>class CreatePasswordReset
  attr_accessor :user_id

  def execute(at)
    user = user_store.get(user_id)
    user.create_password_reset(at)
    user_store.save(user)
  end
end

class ResetPassword
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  attr_accessor :token, :password, :password_confirmation
  
  validate :password, :presence =&gt; true   
  validate :password, :confirmation =&gt; true    
  
  def execute(at)
    if valid?       
      user = user_store.get_by_token(token)       
      user.set_password(password)       
      user_store.save(user)     
    end   
  end 
end</pre></div>
</div>


<p>The corresponding controller methods are super simple as they just treat the result of the execute method as a binary result.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>class PasswordResetController &lt; ApplicationController   
  def update     
    command = ResetPassword.new(params[:reset_password])     
    if command.execute(current_time)       
      redirect_to account_path, :notice =&gt; &quot;We've updated your password&quot;     
    else       
      render :edit     
    end   
  end
end</pre></div>
</div>


<p>The result is</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a web api that maps to operations that a user wants to perform and domain that maps to the entities in my business system. </li>
<li>I have very simple controllers that delegate the domain interactions to method objects that understand the required interactions.</li>
<li>I leverage the validation helpers provided by the framework without polluting my domain with UI detail</li>
</ul>


<p>I do appreciate that validation logic is actually domain logic but this pattern allows a pragmatic allocation of responsibilities in order to increase productivity.</p>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>


<p><strong>Controllers</strong> to ensure only authorised users can perform operations on the domain</p>

<p><strong>Method Objects</strong> to ensure domain interactions are valid and well formed.</p>

<p><strong>Models</strong> to model the domain irrespective of how it&#8217;s being interacted with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The most disappointing announcement for me was that Nottingham has missed out on it&#8217;s bid for the Super Connected Cities fund. It&#8217;s a real shame for the city. There was an additional, smaller, fund announced so hopefully the bid team can dust themselves off and we can go again.</p>

<p>Much was made the day before the budget about discounted lending for small businesses, ie those with less than &pound;50m turnover. This is an amendment to the existing Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme where the government underwrites this lending, protecting the banks.</p>

<p>What hasn&#8217;t changed are the rules around lending. So it will only be beneficial if the problem is the cost of credit rather than access to credit for small companies. Unfortunately what am seeing is a problem with the latter rather than the former. I would have liked to have seen more focus on making finance and mentorship available to first time entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>I believe that the Chancellor has taken a fairly big gamble with taxation. He&#8217;s reducing the taxes of the wealthiest in our society, both personal and corporate, with the hypothesis that this will stimulate investment and spending. It will be very hard to judge whether this has had a directly attributable effect whatever the outcome.</p>

<p>Esendex and it&#8217;s team members are probably broadly better off as a result of this budget. Whether the country is, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>This leaves us with an important responsibility. We must continuing growing, exporting and investing so that we can further contribute to our local economy and community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have been caught out by this for a while with a Rails app that suddenly stopped seeing code changes to classes as I was redeveloping.. Not being able to test with spork running really slowed down my development cycle. Thankfully someone found a fix.</p>

<pre><code>config.cache_classes = true

<p>with this</p>

<pre><code>config.cache_classes = !(ENV['DRB'] == 'true')

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Rest APIs</a>&nbsp;are a common topic of conversation among the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.esendex.com">Esendex</a>&nbsp;dev team and it was a conversation with @jbjon and @samwessel this week that inspired an experiment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a>&nbsp;whereby a<span style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">&nbsp;REST client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. Your API shouldn&#8217;t be fixed but should be discoverable. Clients shouldn&#8217;t be locked into a tight coupling with your API but should be able to adapt has it changes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">What also came up was the notion that the mark of a well tested system was that you could through away all of your code and be confident that you could rebuild it completely based on the tests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">So I set myself an exercise. Could I build an API by putting myself in the shoes of a developer discovering the API for the first time. My tools Cucumber and Firefox.</span></p>
