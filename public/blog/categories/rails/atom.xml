    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This caused me a bit of heartache and I found little to help via the usual channels.</p>

<p>I'd upgraded a Rails 2 app that used Delayed_Job to Rails 3 and was deploying the Heroku Cedar stack. Jobs were being queued but would fail immediately when trying to deserialise with</p>

<pre><code>uninitialized constant Syck::Syck
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>when trying to parse and initialise the handler. Irritatingly the worker logs were showing the jobs as successful.</p>

<p>After messing around with trying to explicitly set the YAML parser in <code>config/boot.rb</code> I found the solution.</p>

<p><code>Syck</code> isn't available on the Heroku Cedar stack so you have to include the <code>Psych</code> gem.</p>

<pre><code>gem 'pysch'
</code></pre>

<p>I then ran this on the console to resubmit the jobs and all was good</p>

<pre><code>Delayed::Job.all.each do |job| job.invoke_job ; job.destroy end
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have been caught out by this for a while with a Rails app that suddenly stopped seeing code changes to classes as I was redeveloping.. Not being able to test with spork running really slowed down my development cycle. Thankfully someone found a fix.</p>

<p>Replace this line in test.rb</p>

<pre><code>config.cache_classes = true
</code></pre>

<p>with this</p>

<pre><code>config.cache_classes = !(ENV['DRB'] == 'true')
</code></pre>

<p>and development is back to full speed.</p>
