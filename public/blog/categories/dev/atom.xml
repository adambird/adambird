<p>Are you a developer? Are you a business owner who employs developers? Have you heard about<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk"> CodeClub</a>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Code Club is a nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged 9-11. The mission is&nbsp;to give every child in the UK the chance to learn to code. The&nbsp;aim to have a Code Club in 25% of primary schools in the UK by the end of 2014.</p>

<p>What's not to like about being part of that.</p>

<p>A new term is about to start so I urge you to contact your local primary school, either local to home or work, and volunteer to run a club for a term. All the materials are made available by Code Club so it's super easy.</p>

<p>If you're a developer you just have to inspire hungry young minds.</p>

<p>If you employ developers then this a perfect personal development opportunity for your team and a real opportunity for you to give something to your community.</p>

<p>If you're in Nottingham then get in touch with me (<a href="mailto:adam.bird@esendex.com">adam.bird@esendex.com</a>) as the City Council are very, very keen to find ways they can help local employers to make this happen.</p>

<p>So, to summarise</p>

<ul>
<li>Go here <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/">http://codeclub.org.uk/</a></li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
<li>Inspire the next generation</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://adambird.com/delayedjob-syck-woes-when-deploying-to-heroku"/>

    <id>http://adambird.com/delayedjob-syck-woes-when-deploying-to-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This caused me a bit of heartache and I found little to help via the usual channels.</p>

<p>I'd upgraded a Rails 2 app that used Delayed_Job to Rails 3 and was deploying the Heroku Cedar stack. Jobs were being queued but would fail immediately when trying to deserialise with</p>

<pre><code>uninitialized constant Syck::Syck
</code></pre>

<p>when trying to parse and initialise the handler. Irritatingly the worker logs were showing the jobs as successful.</p>

<p>After messing around with trying to explicitly set the YAML parser in <code>config/boot.rb</code> I found the solution.</p>

<p><code>Syck</code> isn't available on the Heroku Cedar stack so you have to include the <code>Psych</code> gem.</p>

<pre><code>gem 'pysch'
</code></pre>

<p>I then ran this on the console to resubmit the jobs and all was good</p>

<pre><code>Delayed::Job.all.each do |job| job.invoke_job ; job.destroy end
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://adambird.com/decoupling-the-domain-from-the-interface-with"/>
    <updated>2012-05-08T10:07:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://adambird.com/decoupling-the-domain-from-the-interface-with</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MVC (model-view-controller) is a well established pattern for developing web applications which I've used with both Rails and ASP.NET. Both of these frameworks provide powerful interface add-ons, for example validations, with which you can decorate your models and let the framework do a lot of heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>However, I've found that using these can lead to a leaky coupling between domain and UI logic which slowly and inexorably adds complexity and maintainability headaches.</p>

<p>I've started using a new approach that I'm finding more flexible but has enough pragmatism to leverage the framework hooks and features.</p>

<h3>Treat the web app as an API</h3>


<p>Whatever you do, make the web application url scheme work with resources. For example if you need to expose a password reset feature you would do the following</p>

<p><code>POST /password_resets</code></p>

<p>You would then provide a link to the created password reset request in an email</p>

<p><code>GET /password_resets/wieurh2398hf38h83h028f2=f92-0fw0f</code></p>

<p>The the user would then submit a new password with</p>

<p><code>PUT /password_resets/wieurh2398hf38h83h028f2=f92-0fw0f</code></p>

<p>All good so far. But here's the next stage</p>

<h3>Resources are not necessarily domain objects</h3>


<p>When I create a password reset request I'm not actually creating a record in a database somewhere, I'm actually performing an operation on a User domain object to append a random token that I can use to look up the user record when the user clicks on the link.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>class User
  def create_password_reset_token(at)
    password_reset_token = SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64
    password_reset_token_expires_at = at.utc + (60*60*24)
  end
end</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Enter the method object. For this interaction I need two. CreatePasswordReset and ResetPassword.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>class CreatePasswordReset
  attr_accessor :user_id

  def execute(at)
    user = user_store.get(user_id)
    user.create_password_reset(at)
    user_store.save(user)
  end
end

class ResetPassword
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  attr_accessor :token, :password, :password_confirmation
  
  validate :password, :presence =&gt; true   
  validate :password, :confirmation =&gt; true    
  
  def execute(at)
    if valid?       
      user = user_store.get_by_token(token)       
      user.set_password(password)       
      user_store.save(user)     
    end   
  end 
end</pre></div>
</div>


<p>The corresponding controller methods are super simple as they just treat the result of the execute method as a binary result.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>class PasswordResetController &lt; ApplicationController   
  def update     
    command = ResetPassword.new(params[:reset_password])     
    if command.execute(current_time)       
      redirect_to account_path, :notice =&gt; &quot;We've updated your password&quot;     
    else       
      render :edit     
    end   
  end
end</pre></div>
</div>


<p>The result is</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a web api that maps to operations that a user wants to perform and domain that maps to the entities in my business system. </li>
<li>I have very simple controllers that delegate the domain interactions to method objects that understand the required interactions.</li>
<li>I leverage the validation helpers provided by the framework without polluting my domain with UI detail</li>
</ul>


<p>I do appreciate that validation logic is actually domain logic but this pattern allows a pragmatic allocation of responsibilities in order to increase productivity.</p>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>


<p><strong>Controllers</strong> to ensure only authorised users can perform operations on the domain</p>

<p><strong>Method Objects</strong> to ensure domain interactions are valid and well formed.</p>

<p><strong>Models</strong> to model the domain irrespective of how it's being interacted with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have been caught out by this for a while with a Rails app that suddenly stopped seeing code changes to classes as I was redeveloping.. Not being able to test with spork running really slowed down my development cycle. Thankfully someone found a fix.</p>

<p>Replace this line in test.rb</p>

<pre><code>config.cache_classes = true
</code></pre>

<p>with this</p>

<pre><code>config.cache_classes = !(ENV['DRB'] == 'true')
</code></pre>

<p>and development is back to full speed.</p>

    <link href="http://adambird.com/base-view-model-in-aspnet-mvc"/>
    <updated>2010-11-08T13:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://adambird.com/base-view-model-in-aspnet-mvc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I needed to reference some user context variables from within my site master page that had some logic behind their retrieval.</p>

<p>In this example I need to choose the display language for a user.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check cookie present indicating user's language preference</li>
<li>if not use HTTP language header</li>
<li>if not use the application default language</li>
</ol>


<p>The pattern I've ended up using is to implement a base view model from which all my specific view models inherit as follows:<span style=""> </span></p>

<p><code></code></p>

<p><code></code></p>

<p><code></code></p>

<p><code>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>public class BaseViewModel {     
    public string UserLanguage     
    {      
       get      
       {          
           return HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies[&quot;language&quot;] != null        
               ? HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies[&quot;language&quot;].Value           
               : CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TwoLetterISOLanguageName;     
        }
    } 
}</pre></div>
</div>

</code></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I then use the generic class for the master page</p>

<p><code>&amp;lt;%@ Master Language="C#" Inherits="System.Web.Mvc.ViewMasterPage&amp;lt;BaseViewModel&amp;gt;" %&amp;gt;</code></p>

<p>Which then allows me to reference the model in the master page and keep the logic for deciding the language to display centralised.</p>

<p>Not sure I'm wholly happy with the inheritance as it adds a level of dependencies which smells a bit off but in the small application I'm working in it was easy to implement and does what I need.</p>
