<p>Are you a developer? Are you a business owner who employs developers? Have you heard about<a href="http://codeclub.org.uk"> CodeClub</a>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Code Club is a nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged 9-11. The mission is&nbsp;to give every child in the UK the chance to learn to code. The&nbsp;aim to have a Code Club in 25% of primary schools in the UK by the end of 2014.</p>

<p>What's not to like about being part of that.</p>

<p>A new term is about to start so I urge you to contact your local primary school, either local to home or work, and volunteer to run a club for a term. All the materials are made available by Code Club so it's super easy.</p>

<p>If you're a developer you just have to inspire hungry young minds.</p>

<p>If you employ developers then this a perfect personal development opportunity for your team and a real opportunity for you to give something to your community.</p>

<p>If you're in Nottingham then get in touch with me (<a href="mailto:adam.bird@esendex.com">adam.bird@esendex.com</a>) as the City Council are very, very keen to find ways they can help local employers to make this happen.</p>

<p>So, to summarise</p>

<ul>
<li>Go here <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/">http://codeclub.org.uk/</a></li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
<li>Inspire the next generation</li>
</ul>
