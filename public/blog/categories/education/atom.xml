    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So a predictable furore gripped my twitter feed as footage of Lottie Dexter, head of the UK's <a href="http://yearofcode.org">Year of Code</a> initiative, appearance on Newsnight emerged.</p>

<iframe width="500" height="271" src="http://www.adambird.com//www.youtube.com/embed/-7x7GYItzS4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>My concern is not that she doesn't know how to code but that she was able to so comprehensively belittle the very skillset she was trying to apparently promote.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I'm a tech entrepreneur and developer who's directly employed around 50 developers in my companies and thus have interviewed hundreds. As well as that I'm in my second year running <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk">Code Clubs</a> and am a Governor (Director now it's an Academy) at my local secondary school.</p>

<p>If you translate what Lottie was saying to other industries, it'd be like saying you just need to learn how to lay bricks in a straight line and you can build a house.</p>

<p>Belittling the craft of software development, indeed any skill, can only be of detriment to the UK economy. Yes, I understand that the messaging is about breaking down the barriers but that is not going to prepare people for when it gets difficult.</p>

<p>Software development, like all skills, requires hard work, motivation and endeavour to reach a level at which you can make a valuable contribution. We need to help young people to find the motivation to get through those hard times.</p>

<p>The messaging of UK Coding/Lottie Dexter is in danger of just making people feel stupid because they don't get it.</p>

<p>As someone who is trying to teach children to write software, the hardset job I have is keeping them motivated. Giving them context that helps them see why the hard work is worth it. The drop-off rate when we moved from <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> to HTML and then onto <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> was considerable.</p>

<p>The few that have stuck with it have found their own motivation and my role is to nurture and facilitate that. Hopefully turning round those that are wavering.</p>

<p>As an employer, the only people I'm interested in are those that care about what they do, are always looking to better themselves and a prepared to put the work in to better themselves. Those are the people that can make a difference to an organisation and thus to the UK economy.</p>

<p>If we want the build a skills based economy then we should celebrate those that have worked hard to develop those skills not belittle them.</p>
