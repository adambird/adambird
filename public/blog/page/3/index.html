  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spent a little while tearing my hair out on this one. I followed Steve Sanderson&#8217;s post ( <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2008/07/04/options-for-deploying-aspnet-mvc-to-iis-6/">http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2008/07/04/options-for-deploying-aspnet-mvc-t&#8230;</a> ) but I was still getting the classic IIS 404<img src="/images/aspnet-mvc2-wildcard-mapping-on-iis6/Capture_dcran_2010-09-22_10.02.png">
Finally found the answer in the Web Service Extensions section of IIS Manager. I had to enable the ASP.NET v4 extension</p>

<p>But just clicking Allow here didn&#8217;t work. I actually had to go to Properties > Required Files and Allow the aspnet_isapi.dll.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve started working with Git using <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> as a remote repository. This introduces into my life branching as a cheap operation and makes for a potentially different way of working.</p>

<p>After a discussion with the guys at work on Friday afternoon, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve come up with:</p>

<p>Start a new feature =&gt; start a new branch.</p>

<p><code>git branch master [feature branch name]</code></p>

<p>The master branch is preserved for the current release code. My <a href="http://www.hudson-ci.org">Hudson</a> instance is only monitoring that branch for changes and ignoring all other branches.</p>

<p>I then push the branch to my remote repository so I get the benefits of a back-up as well being able to share the branch if I need to collaborate with someone else on it in the future.</p>

<p><code>git push [remote repository address] [feature branch name]</code></p>

<p>The code rythym then becomes add files, commit to the branch and then push to the remote repo branch.</p>

<p>Once the feature is finished then it&#8217;s a case of squashing the commits on my local master branch and then pushing them to the remote copy.</p>

<p><code>git checkout master</code></p>

<p><code>git merge --squash [feature branch name]</code></p>

<p><code>git push</code></p>

<p>Then it&#8217;s just a case of deleting the feature branch when I&#8217;m happy it&#8217;s complete</p>

<p>Would appreciate any thoughts on this, does it sound sensible?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an Agile world unit tests and integration tests, in our case driven <br />by BDD declared stories, are a fundamental part of a development <br />team&#8217;s output. It could be argued that this is the most important <br />element as these both prove the software works and document what it is <br />supposed to do. <p /> Coverage is key to the success of this. The developers need to ensure <br />their tests cover sufficient scenarios so as to ensure the software <br />delivers when used in anger. <p /> The traditional approach is to have a dedicated test team that checks <br />the code in isolation as developers &#8216;can&#8217;t be trusted&#8217; to do it <br />themselves. <p /> Personally I think this is balderdash. <p /> The test-team-as-gatekeeper approach encourages a lack of <br />responsibility in the development team. They can produce what they <br />like, safe in the knowledge that the test team will pick it up. And, <br />if they don&#8217;t, well they&#8217;re mainly to blame rather than the <br />developers. After all, they&#8217;re not testers. <p /> Far better to have developers engaged all the way to delivery and beyond. <p /> Pair programming, peer reviews and giving rapid iterations for the <br />customer to critique and break all ensure the coverage is complete. <br />But there is nothing like actually engaging with the user to really <br />bring home the importance of the feature being worked on or to bring <br />in to stark relief the usability assumptions they&#8217;ve made. <p /> So, death to test teams. There is no place for them in an agile world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Stopped at the Premier Inn in Port Solent to break up the long drive back from France this weekend and am really glad we did. <p /> We arrived at the end of a long day of travelling which was made longer than expected by very slow progress getting off the ferry and through passport control. Incidentally the immigration officer was in fine spirits given the knackered and undoubtedly surly holiday makers he was encountering. <p /> The woman on reception at the hotel couldn&#8217;t do enough to help us: <p /> Parking was full so we were concerned about 4 bikes on the back of the car in the overflow car park - no problem we&#8217;ll put them in a meeting room for you. <br />We were too late for food from nearby restaurants - no problem, here&#8217;s a takeaway delivery menu <br />Takeaway won&#8217;t take our order because there isn&#8217;t a house number to go with the postcode - no problem, I&#8217;ll speak to them. <p /> The room was clean, a decent size with comfy beds. We all had a great nights sleep. <p /> Breakfast the next morning was busy so we had to wait for a table, the staff member suggested we help ourselves to coffee and juice while we waited on the reception seating. There were about 10 families waiting but there was enough seating and because of the progressive approach of making sure we all had a drink in our hands everyone was happy waiting. When we had breakfast the food was plentiful and decent enough quality. <p /> There were so many opportunities for the staff to turn our stay into a bit of a pain through going through the motions rather than helping. Instead every one of them were friendly, helpful and it worked wonders. We left refreshed, fed and pleased we&#8217;d stayed the night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just finished reading this for the first time many, many years after first watching and loving Bladerunner, the film it inspired. <p /> It&#8217;s a wonderfully dark and deep story, far more so than the film. The vulnerability of Deckard, subsumed in the naivety and beliefs of the post-apocalyptic world he inhabits, is a far cry from the cerebral, flawed hero around which Ridley Scott&#8217;s film is centred. Philip K Dick&#8217;s androids and humans are much less binary than their cinematographic counterparts.
They are both enthralling works in their own right and if you&#8217;ve only got round to seeing Bladerunner, you should definitely make time to read the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Traditionally, not wanting to come home is considered the sign of a good holiday. You never want the fun to end. <p /> However, I reckon being ready to come home is a pretty good indication that you&#8217;re refreshed, recharged and ready to take on the world again. Your holiday has done it&#8217;s job. Assuming of course you&#8217;ve had a good time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Competitive cycling is a demanding mistress. Couple that with a career and a family and you have a recipe for doing some serious damage to yourself. <p /> I sit here after two months of enforced cycling lay-off through being repeatedly ill and am forced to reflect on what went wrong. Blood tests show me to be in super shape but I still can&#8217;t do any exercise without developing some kind of illness. Sore throat, aching, headaches, etc, etc. The conclusion that my doctor has come to is that I&#8217;ve trained and worked myself into the ground. I&#8217;m just knackered. Unable to fight off the day to day infections we never normally notice. <p /> I have a hard and demanding job and a wonderful, but demanding family (in a good way, obviously). Training happens in the early hours before the the rest of the family stir. Sleep and rest are something that fits in around everything else and generally I try and get away with the minimum. <p /> My job also involves some long-haul travel and I have seen it as a fantastic opportunity to get some training in. Last time I was in San Francisco, I embraced the jet-lag so it was easy to get up for training at 5am, get 3 hours of hard miles in before spending the day working. Invariably catching up on emails from the UK before going to bed later than I should. Being away from the family though meant my time was my own and thus it was an opportunity to train, not to be missed. <p /> Crashing in the Alps probably didn&#8217;t help either but however much I try and rationalise it all and be pragmatic I can&#8217;t help feeling I&#8217;m sitting here watching another season drift by with nothing to show for it. And that hurts, a lot. <p /> I&#8217;m currently the right side of 40 but not by much and with coming to cycling late I&#8217;m desperate to maximise my achievements. Being driven helps me train hard but this has shown me that I need to actually act on all that advice that says rest is a key component of training. Being driven and dumb and is no use to anyone. <p /> So next year is a new approach. Train hard, absolutely, but only when I feel up for it. Move rest and recovery to number 3 in the priority list, after family and work, and see what results materialise.</p>
