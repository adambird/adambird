  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems only fair that I explain what prompted my vitriolic tweet earlier. <p /> I decided to treat myself to Yo Sushi takeaway for lunch today. I wanted something quick and felt I deserved something nice and it&#8217;s just round the corner from the office, perfect. <p /> Got in there, ordered quickly and was told 5 mins. Brilliant. <p /> Oh-no. <p /> I asked if i should wait at the bar and was told that I had to sit on a bar stool next to the door. To be fair, the manager was kind enough to move the cleaners sign. <br />So there I sat shivering in the full blast of the above door air-conditioning like a second-class pariah because I wasn&#8217;t eating in. <p /> Now imagine a different scenario where I&#8217;m invited to sit at the bar, where there was plenty of space. I could have been offered a drink, I could have felt a bit peckish and picked something of the belt. Suddenly my £11 takeaway becomes a £16+ purchase and I&#8217;m having a nicer time. <p /> That old win-win scenario anyone selling something should crave. <p /> Instead I&#8217;m sat shivering on my naughty stool. <p /> Luckily though I&#8217;m in full view of the chef assembling my takeaway who had confirmed the 5 min time with the manager when I ordered. It was bound to be quick. <p /> I take the opportunity to read a few more pages of Bad Blood on my iPhone while I&#8217;m waiting. Pages turn into chapters and finally a chef calls across to me, &#8216;are you the guy waiting for takeaway, sorry I&#8217;ve got it here, it&#8217;s been ready a while&#8217;. <p /> He walks round to bring the food round, very apologetic, but doesn&#8217;t give me the food because he wants to put it in a bag. No problem, except he then leaves it on the counter with the person manning the till. <br />There is a big queue and I&#8217;ve already paid. <p /> So I walk round pick up the food, have to insist that I have paid to the person on the till and then discover that the chef had done just as he said. Put the food in a bag. <p /> No chopsticks, napkins or condiments. <p /> In the end I get them myself. <p /> By this stage I&#8217;m a little cross and the safest course of action for all involved is for me to leave the establishment as quickly as possible. Restricting my fury venting to the aforementioned tweet. <p /> So there you have it. A treat soured through a combination of small-mindedness and ineptitude. <p /> And it was the former, by the manager of all people, that riled me the most.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having already stepped down through lack of time from moving the Beeston CC web site forward, I&#8217;ve stayed out of the discussions to date but I think it&#8217;s got to the point where I would like to give my opinion. <p /> I think the current solution has missed the key requirement of any web site, engagement. <p /> Whatever technology you use, however easy or hard it is to utilise, the content and layout of the site must engage with it&#8217;s audience. <p /> The forum is not doing that. <p /> My belief is that a technical solution has been chosen to suit the capabilities of the operator rather than to suit the purpose of the site. <p /> My choice of Wordpress as the platform was not because I knew how to use it, I was learning as I went along, but it was based on a hunch and a year of experimentation with Ride for Round Hill. This was born out by the success of the site in showcasing the club and attracting lots of new members. The forum approach just makes us look like any other club. Not the vision Adrian, Richard and myself had when we decided to found the club in 2008. <p /> Yes it had it&#8217;s issues but ultimately more people read, commented and posted than the current solution. <p /> Also let&#8217;s not ignore the fact that the most vocal detractors of the old site still aren&#8217;t posting on the new one. <p /> It&#8217;s time to look objectively at what the club needs from the site. I for one think we could do worse than just putting the old site back to the way it was and get some of the passion back into our club. <p /> A few small amendments would allow access to the key information that the people need while retaining the pace and fun of the original vision. <p /> I&#8217;m happy to direct the project, I just need someone with PHP skills (the development environment of Wordpress) to do the implementation. <p /> So Beeston CC your club needs you to find a Beeston dwelling PHP developer who cycles.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/camping-with-kids-a-cure-for-snobbery/photo.jpg">
I&#8217;ll admit that I wasn&#8217;t wholly looking forward to a bank holiday weekend spent camping in the New Forest. The picture above pretty much represented a close approximation to hell in my book. <p /> As the rain came down on Saturday morning i was feeling pretty vindicated. <p /> We were new to this so had a ramshackle collection of camping gear and had to spread ourselves across a very optimistic 4-man Decathlon tent and my super lightweight and compact mountaineering tent from college days. <p /> Where before, as a student mountaineer, I would look down on the &#8216;soft&#8217; campers and their cavernous home-from-homes. Now I was gazing enviously at their dry breakfast and &#8216;reading the paper&#8217; space. <p /> We went out and sorted the tent and are now the proud owners of something akin to a 2-bed apartment that we can fold up and fit in the boot of our car. So we were at least going to be dry and have room to spread out but the real realisation that camping was going to regularly feature in our future plans came from watching the boys. <p /> They were, for the first time, experiencing the freedom we had as children. Roaming around the campsite, messing about with trees, building dens, running around moorland playing football, hide and seek and war games, making new friends over catapult shaped sticks. All within the relative security of the campsite boundary and surrounded by other parents who were all relaxing their usual restrictions on child movements in the same way. <p /> It wasn&#8217;t a utopian paradise but you felt that pretty much every parent was looking out for all children. The intent was that children should have fun being children. <br /> Times have changed and whatever the rights and wrongs, children can&#8217;t roam the streets and fields as we did. <p /> Camping is a way to give that back to my children and if it means giving up a few home comforts and realigning my views on what constitutes a holiday then it&#8217;s without doubt a price worth paying. <p /> It also wasn&#8217;t quite purgatory as my Bialetti espresso maker works brilliantly on a camping stove. And, truth be told, I had a great time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A truly stunning day in the Alps today. <br />Julian and I started early from Grenoble and headed south and then up the valley towards Bourg d&#8217;Oisans. We turned left at Rochetaillé and took on the mighty climb up to the Col du Glandon and the Col de la Croix de Fer. <p /> The premise for this trip was a Marmotte Recce for me and a first taste of Alpine cycling for Julian. Chapeau indeed to the man who&#8217;s first Alpine Col was to be the Croix de Fer. <p /> The weather was perfect, not too warm at the bottom, not too hot at the top. The climbing was hard, especially the section out of Rivier d&#8217;Allemont which involved a demoralising hurtle down several hairpins as we saw our hard-earned metres of elevation fall away in front of us, followed by a tough and steep section o regain them again. <p /> Once we reached the Lac de Grand Maison we&#8217;d broken the back of it and despite the headwind the last few miles to the snow covered Col were a joy. <p /> Given that this is the first and &#8216;easiest&#8217; of the climbs I&#8217;ll face in a few weeks time on the Marmotte, I&#8217;m now a little more daunted by the prospect. <p /> I left Julian at the point as I fancied another Col (Col d&#8217;Ornon) before heading back and thoroughly enjoyed the exhilarating hurtle back down the way we&#8217;d come. <p /> The Col d&#8217;Ornon was a bit of an anti-climax of the magnificence of the Croix de Fer but I&#8217;m glad I got as many miles in as possible while I was in the neighbourhood. <p /> On the way back the wind had picked up an awful lot and the lovely descent back to Vizille we&#8217;d been looking forward to for most of the day turned out to be quite a slog. <br />Luckily I hooked up with another cyclist and we quickly, in silence, established a rhythm of turns at the front thanks to the international language of cycling. Later on we actually attempted conventional verbal communication, ie he spoke English, and it turned out Francois was also in the area on Marmotte Recce. <p /> He seemed as daunted as me.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
