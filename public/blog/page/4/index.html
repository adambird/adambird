  <div class="entry-content"><p>Competitive cycling is a demanding mistress. Couple that with a career and a family and you have a recipe for doing some serious damage to yourself. <p /> I sit here after two months of enforced cycling lay-off through being repeatedly ill and am forced to reflect on what went wrong. Blood tests show me to be in super shape but I still can&#8217;t do any exercise without developing some kind of illness. Sore throat, aching, headaches, etc, etc. The conclusion that my doctor has come to is that I&#8217;ve trained and worked myself into the ground. I&#8217;m just knackered. Unable to fight off the day to day infections we never normally notice. <p /> I have a hard and demanding job and a wonderful, but demanding family (in a good way, obviously). Training happens in the early hours before the the rest of the family stir. Sleep and rest are something that fits in around everything else and generally I try and get away with the minimum. <p /> My job also involves some long-haul travel and I have seen it as a fantastic opportunity to get some training in. Last time I was in San Francisco, I embraced the jet-lag so it was easy to get up for training at 5am, get 3 hours of hard miles in before spending the day working. Invariably catching up on emails from the UK before going to bed later than I should. Being away from the family though meant my time was my own and thus it was an opportunity to train, not to be missed. <p /> Crashing in the Alps probably didn&#8217;t help either but however much I try and rationalise it all and be pragmatic I can&#8217;t help feeling I&#8217;m sitting here watching another season drift by with nothing to show for it. And that hurts, a lot. <p /> I&#8217;m currently the right side of 40 but not by much and with coming to cycling late I&#8217;m desperate to maximise my achievements. Being driven helps me train hard but this has shown me that I need to actually act on all that advice that says rest is a key component of training. Being driven and dumb and is no use to anyone. <p /> So next year is a new approach. Train hard, absolutely, but only when I feel up for it. Move rest and recovery to number 3 in the priority list, after family and work, and see what results materialise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read with some amusement the recent BBC article about Middle Aged Men In Lycra, Mamils (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-10965608)">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-10965608)</a>. Yes much of it rang true but I can&#8217;t help feeling that there is an element of cynicism and sneering that drives that sort of moniker. <p /> It&#8217;s the same in most sports-cum-leisure activities. The hard-core of &#8216;real&#8217; participants look down their noses at these johnny-cum-latelys as some how not worthy of participating in &#8216;their&#8217; sport. Turn-up on something expensive with which to participate in the sport like a carbon race frame or high-end clothing and this just fuels their derision. <p /> As an owner of much high-quality kit and no points to my racing name I am truly a Mamil to be derided. It&#8217;s all about the legs apparently. If you haven&#8217;t got the legs you should know your place and let the real-men show you how it&#8217;s done. <p /> And they&#8217;ve done it the hard way. <p /> Balls to the hard-way. I was never very sporty and spent my twenties abusing my body with booze and fags. So no school of hard knocks apprenticeship for me but I have reached middle-age with kids and a decent career. So now I&#8217;m short on time and have a bit of disposable income. <p /> Being able to afford decent kit is brilliant. <p /> Beating other people is great too but bike races only have one winner out of anything up to 100 entrants so chances are high it&#8217;s not going to be me. With that in mind I intend to enjoy myself riding in the bunch, putting myself in the mix and seeing which way the dice fall. <p /> Doing that in the best kit I&#8217;m prepared to afford just adds to the fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are going through a period of major change at <a href="http://www.esendex.com" target="_blank">Esendex</a>. Not only are we moving to new headquarters, opening an office in San Francisco and rebranding, all in the first two weeks of September, but we&#8217;re also hiring like mad.&nbsp;As result of this hiring, I&#8217;m spending a lot of my time at the moment explaining how the development team work to both people who join us and those that we interview.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve realised tonight that as I, and they, describe how the team work, I&#8217;ve become really proud of them</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve embrace Agile development in a big way. We live and breathe TDD (Test Driven Development), BDD (Behaviour Driven Development), CI (Continuous Integration), Pair Programming and any other facets of the agile approach that help us deliver better solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue for many developers is that Agile can be bloody hard work. You have to review and critique what you&#8217;re doing all the time, be it code or practice. It&#8217;s about constantly striving for development bliss, knowing full well that true nirvana is a utopian dream.</p>

<p>Agile is not just a methodology, it&#8217;s a state of mind.</p>

<p>The best developers are driven by this desire for self-improvement and I&#8217;m lucky enough to have a team of them working for me.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been 10 years since my agile epiphany when a fellow contractor on a job suggested I read Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck. For the first time since then I truly believe I have an excellent agile team.&nbsp;Some have learnt the skills over their years with us others have joined us with a rich set of experiences, but all have an overwhelming desire to be the best they can be.</p>

<p>The Esendex messaging platform is rock solid and has been the focus of our efforts and indeed the foundation of our success over the years. But to date, if I&#8217;m honest, we haven&#8217;t really excelled in giving our customers the best web application experience.</p>

<p>Our new Echo product is a huge step forward from our previous Web SMS tool and has improved the experience for many of our customers but it does bear some of the scars of legacy practices. Elements of it are not examples of how good the development team can be and they are desperate to resolve these.</p>

<p>However, being agile is not about wholesale, sweeping and thus high risk changes. It&#8217;s about incremental delivery and improvement. Targeting finite resources on those requirements that are most pressing.</p>

<p>The great thing for me, and you if you&#8217;re a customer, is that that is exactly what the team are doing. Improving the applications every day, and I mean every day.&nbsp;Always striving for quality, always improving our solutions and themselves, always moving forward.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m truly proud of our development team, they know exactly where they are, where they want to be and have a damn good idea of how to get there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m lucky to have them.</p>
